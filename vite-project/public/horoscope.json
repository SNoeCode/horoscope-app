Mercury is also visiting this area of your solar chart until the 8th. The focus is on communicating, learning, connecting, and moving about. You are taking more pride in your mind and personal interests. Later, it's back to business, so enjoy yourself as much as possible now without taking on too much. \n The month features excellent energies for starting new projects or for other hopeful new beginnings, especially in areas related to communication, studies, health, and family. June is also strong for money matters. \n Although you may be exceptionally busy, this doesn\u2019t always feel chaotic. It\u2019s a fine time to stretch your mind and look for opportunities to advance your goals. A learning breakthrough or a special connection can figure strongly. You can feel thoroughly enthused about what you\u2019re learning or communicating now. You\u2019re particularly interested in ways to expand, improve, or grow your projects, studies, and interests. \n However, if you\u2019ve been a little too focused on personal interests at this time, the Full Moon on the 11th will serve as a healthy reminder to aim for a better balance. You may need to pull yourself out of your projects and get out and about from time to time to set things right. This Full Moon brings illumination to learning matters, the fruition of a project, or a turning point for a special idea or interest. Advertising or promotional efforts can be successful. Making presentations or taking tests can also be favorable now. \n A quieter, more practical theme slowly but surely emerges as the month advances, starting with Venus in your resources sector from the 6th forward. It's an excellent time for building upon recent exciting ideas or projects already in place. You enjoy the idea of a steady pace at this time, and you\u2019re extraordinarily resourceful. Your sense of what\u2019s valuable is strong, and you may very well score a good deal on something significant and special. \n Mercury transits your solar fourth house from the 8th to the 26th, and you begin seeking out special moments or patches of rest or relaxation\u2013a break from overthinking and overdoing. You\u2019re a little more observant with people than with facts, and you can enjoy some revealing and warm conversations. Sometimes, this transit coincides with a busy home life or numerous discussions with family and loved ones. There is a lot of attention to making your life more comfortable and secure, especially after the Sun enters this same sector from the 20th. Mercury and Venus complement one another well and are in agreement \u2014 you benefit from slowing down and paying more attention to your comfort levels. \n However, from the 17th forward, Mars brings more demanding daily life and work. This is one of the best periods of the year for gathering the motivation to make positive, healthy lifestyle changes. This transit fires up your desire to excel with your work, chores, routines, and health pursuits. As such, the second half of June shapes up to be quiet but productive. \n Your personal life and domestic world are coming into stronger focus, and while they may have been overactive or complicated earlier this year, things are becoming far more enjoyable and rewarding now. You're more comfortable or settled. A family member is a great friend and ally this month. You might decide to rearrange your living setup or reorganize your work or work environment. \n Saturn entered your sign in late May, and this long-term transit brings a more serious or responsible theme to your life in general. This transit comes in two steps: this year, it runs until September 1st but later returns from February 2026 to April 2028. It's a time of gaining more maturity and restructuring your life in meaningful ways. You\u2019ll be attending to those things you\u2019ve left unfinished or neglected, and you may decide to retrain or learn new skills. It\u2019s a powerful period for stabilizing and strengthening key areas of your life as the focus is now on structure and firmer foundations. You\u2019re also challenged to become more responsible and self-disciplined. Along the way, you\u2019re likely to discover that you can hold your own! \n This month, Jupiter makes a big move: it moves into a new sign, which puts this planet of plenty in your solar fourth house of family, roots, and home until June 2026. This transit can bring about substantial improvements in your personal and domestic life. There can be more rewarding relationships with loved ones, a new addition to your family, the urge to expand, redecorate, or build your home and domestic world, or the beginning of a new, long-term project or business venture. For example, this could be a home-based business, a real estate investment, or a family-focused initiative. It\u2019s time for an upgrade to your living conditions or living arrangements. \n Moving, renovating, or increasing your feelings of safety and comfort can figure strongly as you advance. You\u2019ll also be working on establishing and centering yourself emotionally. You\u2019re thinking about growth and expansion and taking small steps toward improving your life from the ground up. You can be in a celebratory or happily domestic mood during this phase of your life that begins this month. Whatever you\u2019re building, you\u2019re putting your heart and soul into it, maximizing its chances of success. \n Certainly, your desire to expand or grow your home and spend time with your family can temporarily clash with personal responsibilities and restrictions. It can be difficult to fit everything in, so paying more attention to moderation and balance is crucial. By maintaining a sense of equilibrium, you can navigate these potential conflicts with grace. \n The New Moon on the 25th presents you with the opportunity or desire for a fresh start in your domestic life, and you'll find the week following this New Moon particularly strong for focus, optimism, and possibilities. Your desire to improve your personal life soars. Influences now encourage and motivate you to make profound improvements and changes rather than quick or surface fixes, mainly related to home life, family, partnerships, or your inner world. \n More: \n Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Aries \n 2025  Overview \n Jupiter continues to open the lines of communication in your life this year, dear Aries. Later, it boosts your home and family life. \n From June forward, although Jupiter will square your sign, this planet of abundance will feed your sense of security and stability, which can be comforting, especially with both Saturn and Neptune visiting your sign in 2025. While they\u2019re not yet consistent guests, you\u2019re getting the message that things must change. There will be times when you will need to slow\u00a0yourself down and choose your battles wisely. \n You are moving away from false paths that no longer serve you well or transform them into more suitable ones. Still, you have plenty of opportunities to find comfort at home or with family this year. In fact, this is a year in which the major key to success is learning when it\u2019s time to slow down. While it\u2019s a signature Aries trait, Impulsiveness should be tamed somewhat in 2025. You first get this cosmic message with Mars, your ruler, retrograde until February 23rd. Then, Venus turns retrograde in your sign on March 1st. Love and romance are unlikely to make headlines for you this year (2026 is more likely to be a year of change in this department). However, status quo can also work out well. \n Relationships with siblings and possibly neighbors can be stimulating and even healing, and activities close to home (and on or in the home) are highly appealing now. The need or desire for roomier or happier living conditions can come over you from June forward. If circumstances allow, this can be an exciting time to launch new projects or even a business, opening up a world of possibilities. \n Saturn visits your sign from May 24th to September 1st before returning for a longer stay starting in February 2026. It\u2019s a demanding transit, but through its influence, you learn to count on yourself. Of course, your relationship with yourself affects all life \u201cdepartments\u201d in profound ways. The responsibilities you let slide in the past come up for close attention, and while it can sometimes feel like an onslaught, you are more than equipped to meet the challenges. Keep in mind that those things that you\u2019ve managed well in the past are now being rewarded. Saturn is karmic \u2013 you are experiencing what you are due at this point. It\u2019s a powerful time to get your life back on track. The process of getting closer to your true self will involve some restructuring of your attitudes toward professional goals and images. \n The year is strong for studies, writing, and other mental pursuits. More joy can be found in these pursuits, although you can have a tendency to take on more than you can manage at this time, so watch for this! \n More: \n 2025 Yearly Preview Horoscope  and the  Aries 2025  \n \n This Year in Love: Aries \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Aries \n There haven\u2019t been many direct long-term influences on your love life in recent years, dear Aries, but with a set of eclipses in your sign and partnership sector recently, some things have been brewing! These eclipses want you to explore your independence and need for companionship. They ask you, \u201cIs the balance healthy?\u201d If not, you have work to do! \n The final eclipse in this set occurs in 2025 on March 29th, and it\u2019s a Solar Eclipse in your sign.

Chiron continues its transit of your sign. You have experience with this influence. This year, Saturn and Neptune both dip into your sign. While they won\u2019t be visiting your sign consistently until 2026, you\u2019re getting sneak peeks now. This happens for Saturn from May 24th to September 1st and for Neptune from March 30th to October 22nd\u2026. cont\u2019d \n More: \n 2025 Aries Love Horoscope \n \u00a0 \n Here\u2019s to a happy and successful day! \n Note:  Read the sections for both your Sun Sign and Ascendant for a better picture of what lies ahead for the day.

Your desire to enjoy life's simple pleasures, build a business, and feel more comfortable and secure is strong now, and you can find it easier than usual to attract the right resources to you. \n It's an important month for taking charge of your finances and resources, as well as the practical aspects of your life. You could come up with fabulous ideas about how to use your resources more efficiently. As well, you can be excited about exploring and building on your talents. Even so, it\u2019s also a brilliant time for diversifying, sharing, and connecting with others, especially as the month advances. \n Venus moving into your sign on the 6th is especially pleasant since it frames you well, boosts your popularity, and improves your self-image. You have a stronger appetite for fun and pleasure. People see you in a kinder light, in general, and more importantly, you feel good about yourself, more so than usual. You\u2019re mixing well with others, and this can benefit you across the board, whether in business, friendship, or romance. \n Mercury transits your solar third house from the 8th to the 26th, and this transit complements the Venus transit nicely. You\u2019re talking more, connecting with others, getting out and about, and seeking out more information and news. You can do more reading, studying, teaching or guiding, thinking, and speaking. You\u2019re sharp and observant during this supportive transit, and others receive your ideas and the intentions behind your communications well. It\u2019s easier to make quick decisions at this time, and you enjoy a busy rather than hectic pace. Mars moves into a creative sector of your chart on the 17th, and then the Sun also visits your communications house from the 20th. \n But first, the Full Moon on the 11th brings on an eyes-wide-open period regarding an intimate, financial, ownership, or dependency matter. It reminds you to tidy up your finances or dependencies. You become more aware of what you have, need, and want. If you feel guilty or indebted, you\u2019re not working at full capacity, and now is the time to fix the problem first by recognizing it. Be sure to remind yourself that attachments aren\u2019t inherently unhealthy, so do consider ways to become more comfortable with the healthy connections in your life. \n Mars moving into your solar fifth house on the 17th is very supportive. This transit is about discovering or pursuing your passions. Hobbies and creative or competitive pursuits, or a romance, can be in focus. In truth, this transit can also enhance business acumen, as it stimulates better timing, improved energy, and increased confidence. Relationships are passionate and/or you're passionate about your relationships and special projects. \n Saturn's move into your solar twelfth house in late May brought this heavy planet to the background of your solar chart. Saturn will transit this area of your solar chart until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. This puts you in a critical cycle for spiritual renovation, clean-up, and better attention to mental health. You are challenged to take care of unfinished business, regroup, process, and heal. It\u2019s important to rid yourself of regrets or perceived failures and disappointments during this longer-term cycle. \n This month, Jupiter\u2019s shift into your communication sector is a significant influence, lasting until June 2026. Jupiter\u2019s energy is now harmonizing with your sign, enhancing your studies, communications, and potentially your mobility or transportation options. In the period ahead, you\u2019ll likely be especially mentally alert and busy, and you might expand your social circle, update your skills, advertise, or publish in fun, fulfilling ways. This is an exciting time to grow your knowledge base. Your mind is open, and you more enthusiastically (and with less inhibition) share your ideas. More day-to-day contact with friends and family can be healing and pleasurable. \n However, there can be times this month when personal fears, past matters, burdens, or responsibilities to support others interfere with your desire to expand your connections, experiences, and communications. If you\u2019ve lined up too many potential projects or if you\u2019re faced with too many choices, you could reach a point of feeling overwhelmed in the face of other responsibilities that limit your progress or hold you back. \n The energies of the last ten days of June stir your curiosity and sociability. You're coming out of your shell and pursuing your desires more directly and actively. Nevertheless, Venus, goddess of love and your planetary ruler, is in your sign, and you also quite naturally attract what (and who) you want with considerably less effort on your part! \n Personal energy is significantly improving at this time as if a weight has been lifted off your shoulders. This extra \"get up and go\" does wonders for your outlook. The Sun moves into your communications sector on the 20th, spotlighting your daily affairs and your need to learn, connect, communicate, and commute. You\u2019re especially motivated to make positive changes and improvements. Connections and conversations inspire trust. You\u2019re making connections and following your heart. \n You\u2019re in great shape for news or information that sends you in a positive direction or improves your outlook, especially after the New Moon on the 25th. Instead, you might gravitate to information that brings benefits to your life. New ways of communicating, connecting, and getting around can open up for you, putting you in the driver\u2019s seat of your life\u2019s journey. \n Pleasing energy connects communications and learning with creativity in the last week of the month, and the urge to get something done is with you. It\u2019s a creative and dynamic time. You might receive news that opens up doors for you, enjoy some affectionate communications or an innovative learning experience, or you could make some exciting new contacts. You\u2019re alert, ready to make changes, and willing to put yourself out there, and this is a winning combination. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n This Year: Taurus \n 2025  Overview \n Some key influences point to a stabilizing period this year, dear Taurus. Uranus begins its transition out of your sign, and Jupiter\u2019s influence brings more pleasure in what you have. Personal finances, communications, and learning are big themes in your life in 2025. \n It\u2019s not especially well-known about Taurus, but you take your social life to heart \u2013 your relationships not only with a close partner, but also with siblings, neighbors, and friends. 2025 is a year for enriching these relationships. With the North Node in your solar eleventh house most of the year, it\u2019s especially important for you to establish yourself as a team player. \n This period in your life is also a time for building a solid foundation. Finances are looking quite nice, as long as you are moderate with your spending. More day-to-day contact with friends and family, and even in-laws, can be healing and pleasurable. \n With Saturn and Neptune moving into your solar twelfth house this year and next, you\u2019ll be exploring matters of guilt or lack of closure that may affect you more than you know. It will be of enormous benefit if you can settle these matters in the years ahead, because if they are left to fester, they can undermine your happiness and progress. Career matters are also ramping up as you connect with your ambitions. \n Income or handling of money and things can be changing. With money, you\u2019re beginning to thinki outside the box. Uranus continues to stir the pot for you this year, but it\u2019s on its way out of your sign. Do watch for rebellious behavior, but aim to move forward, beyond limitations, and towards a more authentic \u201cyou.\u201d \u00a0However, you no longer feel the need to make a splash when it comes to asserting your independence as Uranus moves on and you close an important chapter of your life. You\u2019re less triggered, more content, and happier with your circumstances. The year 2025 also finds you more communicative, mentally engaged, and busy with exciting interests and projects. \n More:  Yearly  of 2025 \u2013 Taurus  or  2025 Taurus  \n \u00a0 \n \n This Year in Love: Taurus \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Taurus \n Uranus is transitioning out of your sign this year, dear Taurus, and Pluto has moved into a challenging position relative to your sign. As such, in some ways, rebelliousness or instability is leaving your life. In other ways, career or life-path matters are a bit heavier on you in 2025. \n You want the freedom to express yourself, and you don\u2019t want to feel confined, with Uranus continuing its transit of your sign in 2025. This long-term influence is on its way out, but you won\u2019t say goodbye to it for good until April 2026. Independence tends to trump other drives in most areas of your life, including relationships. Relationships may be a little unstable as a result. \n Taurus is known for their rootedness and desire for peace and calm, so the electric Uranian energy in your life may throw a few people you know for a loop! Don\u2019t worry; the important people will adjust and accommodate your need for self-expression. Just try to avoid making unnecessary sweeping changes and discern between rebellious behavior and fair behavior. Make sure you\u2019re making choices on your own terms instead of only  reacting . \n Of course, Uranus has been in Taurus for many years now, and more people are used to this energy. In 2025, it\u2019s especially affecting those born late in the sign of Taurus or with a later Taurus Ascendant: May 14-20 and those with an Ascendant of approximately 23-30 degrees Taurus. \n Soon enough, you won\u2019t be answering to a rebellious muse, and Uranus won\u2019t be putting pressure on you to carve your own path. But this final leg of the Uranus-in-Taurus transit is an easier one as Uranus harmonizes with Saturn, the Moon\u2019s North Node, and Neptune, suggesting a more harmonious, prosperous period for your innovations\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Taurus Love Horoscope \n \u00a0 \n Here\u2019s to a fulfilling and successful day! \n Note:  Read the sections for both your Sun Sign and Ascendant for a better picture of what lies ahead for the day.

While there may be some things you\u2019re putting behind you, you\u2019re looking forward now. You\u2019re more noticeable and even more magnetic than usual. \n This year, the New Moon on May 26th was particularly supportive of your ability to express yourself and appeal to your \u201caudience.\u201d This theme sticks with you until the New Moon this month (on June 25th). You're reinventing yourself! It's a time of year for developing the self. Certainly, you have significant powers of communication on your side in June. \n The first three weeks of the month bring you much attention, after which things feel more predictable and steady. Your head and heart may not always be on the same page this month, as your heart remains attuned to the past and possibly needs extra care and time. You continue to meet your daily responsibilities with gusto, although when the pace of your life slows from the 20th forward, you welcome it. \n From the 6th forward, love matters and certain projects may require mulling. You're seeking pleasure in quiet time, private moments, and perhaps even the past as you explore your feelings on the down-low. Venus will enter your sign on July 4th, and emotions and pleasures will clarify or simplify. For now, you\u2019re dealing with many different layers of your affections, and it\u2019s a good time to process and digest recent events slowly and carefully. Even so, watch for a tendency to attract situations that work against you or are so complicated that they leave you drained and exhausted. Someone may be trying to take advantage of a vulnerability or your tendency to feel guilty, for example. During busy times, aim to draw boundaries with your energy and time. This is a period for \"allowing\" others to appreciate you - in other words, accepting their attention - even if you feel much more comfortable playing a supportive role. \n Mercury continues to excite you mentally until the 8th, after which you\u2019re less concerned about innovations and more focused on your practical affairs. Mercury\u2019s transit of your sign boosts your desire to express yourself until the 8th, and Mars in your communications sector to the 17th reinforces this further, adding a layer of courage, although sometimes impatience as well. The first half of June is powerful for both asserting and expressing yourself, although there can be times when you\u2019re a bit tense or wired. \n You can feel excited to share more by talking, writing, and connecting with others. You communicate persuasively, and others see you as especially wise. Opportunities to expand your mind, learn something valuable, or resolve a conflict may present themselves. \n The Full Moon on the 11th is powerful for attending to close relationships. A matter brewing, buried, or hidden reaches a head, and there can be discoveries or epiphanies about your feelings or a close relationship. There could be new clients, invitations, sudden interest in your services or, more simply, your companionship. \n Old baggage arrives with Mars moving into your solar fourth house from the 17th forward, but the good news is that you have all of the energy and gumption to deal with it hands-on rather than passively allowing it to drive your behavior. Family life is active and possibly demanding. \n The second half of the month plays a little more to your practical side. Money matters assume particular importance to you. Home and family life can be busy, animated, and energetic. Conflicts may emerge, but treat them as the chance to take care of problems once and for all. Mars heats up your personal life and domestic world. While exciting for getting things done around the home, you can sometimes feel that your desires are working against you or that you\u2019re at odds with others during this cycle. You can make this transit work for you with some creativity, however. The trick is to pour excess energy into constructive projects and take a good look at how you\u2019re expressing (or bottling) anger. Increased self-awareness can lead to solutions and improvements. \n Saturn entered Aries on May 24th, moving out of your career sector and into the sector of your solar chart that rules friendships, networking, and dreams/wishes. During this cycle that runs for much of the coming three years, there can be some heaviness or selectiveness in your dealings with friends and perhaps more burdens, limitations, and responsibilities. However, it can also be a time when a friendship deepens and stabilizes. You can set solid, meaningful, long-term plans into motion. You\u2019ll find that your goals are shifting, and you are ready to take on challenges. You can accomplish a great deal with minimal stress. With Saturn in a supportive aspect to your sign, you might enjoy a more stable and steady period. \n Interestingly, Jupiter exits your sign this month--a month primarily devoted to you. This Jupiter transit has been with you for just over a year, boosting your confidence and independence. With Jupiter\u2019s new transit, starting on June 9th and sticking with you until June 30th, 2026, you\u2019ll build upon exciting ideas and prospects you picked up during the lucky planet\u2019s journey through your sign. It\u2019s time to secure your place in the world with a quieter, comfier transit, which may be just what you need now! This transit is filled with potential for growth and security. \n A windfall or significant gift can be in focus. You\u2019re pouring more heart, energy, and perhaps money into your comfort and security. It\u2019s an excellent time to build something solid for yourself, especially a business, but this can extend to a relationship, home, hobby, or more. \n The desire to expand, grow, or enjoy your money and things can sometimes clash with your social pursuits this month, however. For example, there can be drains on your resources from friends or from experimenting with new ventures. Instead, the desire to nest, get comfortable, and enjoy more steadiness in your life can clash with responsibilities to friends or groups at this time. \n The Sun heads out of your sign on the 20th, officially pulling you into the introspective phase that has been coming on gradually. You\u2019re likely to delight in taking some extra time for yourself. Finances are looking up. You conduct yourself with more self-respect in the business world and attract respect. This can be a good time for well-researched purchases, but impulse buys can be decent as well, as your intuition is quite good for money. The New Moon on the 25th heralds a new beginning with money and things. \n In the last ten days of the month, beautiful energy is with you for psychological or physical healing programs, financial initiatives, an awakening of inner life, and powerful intuition. You can rely wonderfully on your intuition now, and business pays off. Investing in or putting money into improvements to the home can be in order. Family businesses can thrive now. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n This Year: Gemini \n 2025  Overview \n It\u2019s an exciting year for you, dear Gemini. You have expansive Jupiter in your sign until June, and Uranus moves into Gemini in July. It\u2019s a year for exploring your needs and pursuing your dreams. Your personality, image, body image, and self-confidence expand to new levels, and you see whole new possibilities. Your vision of life is panoramic. \n It\u2019s a time for different experiences, adventures, or learning journeys, although there can be some moments of discontent or restlessness. The year finds you most bold and intriguing. Partnership, publishing, or adventurous opportunities might come knocking at your door. \n Promising developments are also likely with finances in 2025. You feel you\u2019re moving forward and growing, craving freedom and independence, and perhaps facing some endings in the process. \n As you\u2019re freer to be yourself, many accept you more readily. Still, subtle yet profound changes within you affect your relationships with others and how you present yourself. Your integrity strengthens. \n Stirrings and changes in career goals, professional interests, or social standing could be catalysts for this growth process. You\u2019re learning about your limits and potential in these life departments. More discipline and structure in your social life, with friends, and happiness pursuits can benefit you greatly. Many Geminis will be starting or building businesses this year that will benefit them for years to come. This will not come without hard work and persistence, but you are likely to enjoy the process more if you work on those things that really matter in the long term. \n You\u2019re often feeling more powerful, persuasive, and connected with your beliefs and principles in 2025. \n Uranus awakens your consciousness to areas of your life where you felt restricted. Events now and in upcoming years might free you from confining situations or conditioning patterns. You\u2019re gaining inspiration. A new person, influence, or path can bring changes. You\u2019re moving into your \u201cnew normal.\u201d \n More:  2025 Gemini  \n Or:  2025 Yearly  \n \n This Year in Love: Gemini \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Gemini \n Jupiter is the ruler of your partnership sector, and a key factor in your relationship astrology, dear Gemini. In 2025, Jupiter divides itself between your sign, representing your personality, and your resources sector. \n Jupiter\u2019s current transit of your solar chart can point to current needs, but it also reveals areas or places in your life where love can be found or where it can flourish.

You're less inclined to take action in your day-to-day life until the last week of the month. You're quite talkative, however, from the 8th onward. You may not be revealing much, but you're inclined to speak up, make connections, and move about. \n While your mind is active, it's important to recognize that it's time for a spiritual or emotional check-up. If there are loose ends in your life to take care of, this is the time to do so as your solar year winds down. It's a good time for retreats and breaks if you can manage it. You're not exactly putting everything on hold, but you are taking more time for yourself to recharge. You may be talking ahead of yourself about things that you are not quite certain about. \n Although you\u2019re technically in a period of relative slumber until the Sun enters Cancer on the 20th, you\u2019re certainly attracting positive attention. From the 6th, you have excellent planetary support for personal appeal, friendships, networking, team efforts, group associations, vitality, beauty, body ego, and style. Others thoroughly enjoy your company and want to be around you. Your dreams and plans are received well. \n This theme is due to Venus transiting your social sector from the 6th forward, increasing your enjoyment, pleasure, and attraction factors. Especially in combination with Mercury in your sign from the 8th and Mars in your communications sector from the 17th, it\u2019s one of your best times for teamwork, new and exciting projects, making valuable contacts and connections, and learning new and interesting things. You\u2019re attracted to the original, unusual, and unconventional now. Your social life shouldn\u2019t subtract from your efforts to detox, wind down, and recharge your emotional batteries. If it does, it\u2019s time to make some changes! \n The Full Moon on the 11th can remind you of work responsibilities and health matters, and good energy is with you for attending to these things. \n From the 17th, you have considerable energy for learning, pet projects, and speaking up about matters that are important to you. The only caution involved with this change of pace is to avoid being too impatient for results and too hasty getting where you want to go. While you can be a little rushed at times, you communicate with extraordinary magnetism and sizzle, saying what\u2019s on your mind and enjoying the responses you receive. You're also learning things at a rapid pace. It\u2019s a good time for asserting yourself, only if what you\u2019re expressing comes from a place of realness, not as the result of impatience or too-quick reactions. \n June is a good month for getting your bearings and taking care of unfinished business, and as it progresses, you really blossom and come into your own. You\u2019re starting your new solar year on the right foot and with Jupiter, the planet of plenty, in your sign! Visiting for over a year, Jupiter is set to bring more meaning and pleasure or satisfaction to your life. \n Jupiter\u2019s move into your sign is a powerful event. In the last year, you\u2019ve been building your spiritual confidence in subtle ways. Now, you\u2019re less affected or intimidated by your usual fears and inhibitions. Your confidence in your intuition has also improved. These things will help you embrace this new Jupiter transit running from this month to June 2026. You should enjoy more self-confidence, and the projection of a fresh \u201cnew you\u201d is bound to attract attention. New connections are likely. \n You\u2019ll be building and enhancing your personal image, manner, attitude towards life and independence, confidence levels, relationship with your body, and self-assertion. You\u2019re learning \u2014 or relearning \u2014 to take charge and \u201cown\u201d these things. It\u2019s a time of fully embracing your innate traits. New physical activities, businesses, or a fresh start regarding how you walk into a room or grab opportunities can be part of the picture. \n Jupiter helps enhance your image and repairs your relationship with yourself. You\u2019ll find people more overtly appreciating you and your general vibe. \n Saturn recently began a long-term transit of your sector of career and reputation. This transit will be with you until September 1st and then return in February 2026 for a cycle that runs until April 2028. During this period, you are likely to reassess your career and standing, realigning your attitudes to serve your purpose better and get on track. Circumstances remind you of the importance of structure, responsibility, and reputation in your life. You can make changes in the coming years so that your career path better reflects the principles closest to your heart. There are more significant responsibilities, but also greater accomplishments possible. \n Your desire for more personal freedom could sometimes clash with your professional goals or with the attention you feel is needed for your responsibilities to the outside world. Your stronger need for independence or space can come with a price! The temptation may be to overdo it in both areas, but a compromise is less stressful. \n In the last week of the month, your life picks up pace. There's an increase in activity, as well as your taste for it! Gears are set into motion for new plans and goals, friendships form, partnerships expand, and doors open for positive change. The Sun moves into your sign on the 20th, launching an important month for turning over a new leaf. Your personal New Moon occurs on the 25th, and you are holding the power to push forward with your plans. If you need to update your image, this is the time. It\u2019s a good time for positive feedback. This can be a time when you\u2019re acting more decisively, you\u2019re more responsive, and others especially enjoy your input. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n This Year: Cancer \n 2025  Overview \n Until June, you\u2019re especially drawn to your inner world, dear Cancer. This period offers a sense of security in introspection. You might sometimes prefer to keep to yourself, where it seems safer and happier, but you can also be a pillar of support for others. It doesn\u2019t feel like a time for major changes or decisions. In reality, you\u2019re in a phase of great introspection, questioning your approaches and paths, and it\u2019s a valuable process. \n June ushers in Jupiter into your sign, and you\u2019re coming into your own\u2013and into the light. Those who are used to your supportive, low-key nature might feel a bit disoriented. However, this is an exhilarating phase that\u2019s all about discovering your need for self-expression and tapping into your inner reservoirs of confidence. It\u2019s a time when opportunities come to you, and health and wellness pursuits become more appealing, enhancing your energy and confidence. \n This year, your expectations from relationships are higher. You find others\u2019 concern about the future and having a life plan more attractive. The allure of future planning and life goals is stronger for yourself, as well. After a period of unrest, your social life is finally beginning to stabilize, bringing a sense of relief. \n Life departments where you begin to see the need for more special attention in 2025 are your own life path goals, career, attention to structure and discipline, and reputation. The challenge is to be more realistic and practical in these areas while also drawing on your imagination and creativity. As you open the door to a more fulfilling approach to your work, duties, and routines, your self-confidence and happiness grow. \n Changes in transportation, communication, mobility, and education are in the works this year. You\u2019re connecting with (and reaching) more people as the year advances, as well as with your own desire to learn, share, guide, explore, and discover. \n More:  2025 Cancer Preview Horoscope  or  2025 Cancer  \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Cancer \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Cancer \n The year 2025 brings special emphasis to your private life, personal goals, and sense of self, dear Cancer. It\u2019s a time of more enjoyment and pleasure from these areas of life. Until June, you take more time to yourself or devote extra time to healing, rejuvenation, and your private life. Once Jupiter enters your sign in June, however, you\u2019re coming out of your shell. \n Uranus has been in your social sector for many years, and 2025 is no exception, but the big news is that Uranus is nearing the end of this influence. This year, Uranus is transitioning out of your social sector and will leave it for good in April 2026! \n This year, Uranus transits point to lively, unusual, and exciting friendships. There can also be disruptions and unreliability in your social life and off-and-on affinities. Interestingly, Uranus is one of two rulers of your intimacy sector, and with it spending several years in your friendship/networking sector, for some Cancers, there can be significant intimate connections with friends or friends of friends. \n With Uranus transitioning into your privacy sector, however, there can be a very private, quiet, sacrificing, or compassionate theme in your intimate world.

Your professional or public life and reputation get a boost. Venus here can be excellent for your reputation and career and strong for business relationships. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a nice change in a creative or romantic pursuit. It's a great time for a sudden epiphany or idea that can have long-term benefits. This Full Moon brings feelings to light quite dramatically. It's a playful, expressive, and creative time. Romantic relationships get a boost. \n The first half of June is high energy, with you in charge and in the lead. The pace can be wild at times. As the month moves forward, it becomes wiser to conserve your energy. From the 20th, you are feeling strong, but don't jump into action just yet - take the leap in your imagination first and see how it feels before taking a big step. Practical and business matters thrive. \n Mercury transits your privacy sector from the 8th to 26th, however, and you\u2019re a little more insular or observant on a mental level during this cycle. You tend to adapt to stressors through further contemplation or escaping into your own world. It's a time for giving your life some thought rather than diving right in, which is your usual style! Once Mars leaves your sign on the 17th, you'll find this more straightforward. \n For much longer than usual, Mars has been animating your sign, and on June 17th, it moves into your resources sector. Mars will be here, heating up your drive to handle, accumulate, and manage your money and personal possessions until early August. The desire to take charge of your income and to be self-reliant dominates. You are making the connection between money and freedom. Personal pressures are lifting, and you are feeling stronger, more in control, and more mature as well. The way to your heart now is a practical route; you're more interested in reliability and security than you are in flowery attention. \n Saturn recently moved into your spirit sector and will visit it for much of the coming three years. Its first round has already begun and runs until September 1st. Part Two will span from February 2026 to April 2028. This transit can bring more focus on teaching, publishing, and sharing information in your career or in preparation for it. It\u2019s also a stabilizing, supportive energy that helps you meet your responsibilities. Getting organized becomes a priority, and it's easier than usual! Saturn moving in harmony with your sign may not be the most glamorous of transits, but it does help round out your life. \n Jupiter slips into your privacy sector this month, where it will spend just over a year, and this can lead to a stronger sense of spiritual peace, a deep inner calm, preparing you internally for outward changes when Jupiter passes over your Sun starting in June 2026. This transit can bring some magic to your inner world, along with the ability to take things in stride. Even though you may be working behind the scenes or a little more withdrawn than usual in the year ahead, this transit helps you to find comfort in a little more introspection and solitude. Still, it\u2019s seldom a lonely sort of self-absorption. Self-contentment is a more apt word to describe it. If you need help during this Jupiter transit, it tends to come just in the nick of time from unanticipated or hidden sources. \n You will be building tremendous inner and spiritual strength in the year ahead, and it all begins now! It\u2019s an excellent period for giving of yourself on a charitable level, as you will derive much satisfaction from doing so. You may find that a partner\u2019s daily life or health improves nicely during this period. Fears and anxieties that may have weighed you down with guilt or pressure can easily be faced and lifted this year. \n You\u2019re in great shape for enjoying your own company, gaining more peace and quiet, trusting your intuition, and supporting others or doing behind-the-scenes good deeds. \n Still, if you\u2019ve lined up too many potential projects or if you\u2019re faced with too many choices, you could reach a point of feeling overwhelmed at times this month. While you have a great need and desire to enjoy more downtime, privacy, and rest or detox, outside obligations, such as courses or special goals, can be calling you, and you may feel limited until you find workarounds and a compromise. \n From the 20th forward, you begin the wind-down period of your solar year. You require some extra time alone to sort out your plans, to recharge your energy and motivation levels, and to avoid overload. Generally speaking, it\u2019s not the best time to get started on a significant project or new initiative unless it\u2019s about doing preparatory work for said endeavor. Your extra sensitivity now can sometimes seem to work against you at this time of year, but it can help you see yourself a little more clearly since, much of the time, you can be working on autopilot and possibly ignoring some important emotional or spiritual needs in the process. Now is the time of the year to get in touch, and it\u2019s enlightening! \n The New Moon on the 25th brings take-charge energy for making time for yourself, introspection, and attention to your inner world. You may need more time to process recent events and feelings. This New Moon brings your strong attention to rest, repose, and healing, launching an important period of looking for answers within. \n This doesn\u2019t mean you have to while away your time or sit on your hands. In fact, with the Sun and Jupiter connecting around the time of this New Moon and painting the energies of the last week of June warm colors, you\u2019re inclined to enjoy yourself fully, even if this is mostly happening behind the scenes. Plus, Mercury enters your sign on the 26th, and you're mentally busy and positive, entering a new phase and enjoying your fresh start. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n This Year: Leo \n 2025  Overview \n Until June, and especially from February forward, it\u2019s a time for making connections and inspiring new ideas, dear Leo. Your social circle is expanding, although you should watch for excesses. While the saying goes that you can never have too many friends, you don\u2019t want to spread yourself thin. Similarly, avoid beginning so many new projects that you scatter yourself across them. \n However, friends or groups can be supportive, and, for some Leos, romance ties in with friendship or group associations. Your team spirit runs high, and you might make wonderful contributions to a group or with associates you can feel proud of. \n You might consider Jupiter\u2019s entry into the sign behind yours in June as the opportunity for a retreat of sorts \u2013 a year-long cycle that prepares you for Jupiter\u2019s transit of Leo that will begin in July 2026. You come into closer touch with your emotional renewal needs now. It\u2019s probably best to defer the bigger choices and decisions to a later date. While there can be times that you feel in limbo, you can take full advantage of this period for extra rest and introspection. Love becomes private somehow, or you find joy in different pleasures and pastimes. You might be keeping quiet about a relationship or your feelings. \n With Uranus on its way out of your career and reputation sector, you\u2019ll enjoy this planet\u2019s lessons as well as look forward to more stability with these life departments. Discovering your true calling comes more organically now. Friendships will be going through some changes, offering the potential for new connections and alliances. Similarly, partnerships also transform this year and in upcoming years, presenting opportunities for new and exciting collaborations. Someone you didn\u2019t like in the past can become an ally, showing the potential for transformation in relationships. Resolutions of a long-standing problem in a relationship can figure strongly, bringing a sense of not only closure but also personal growth. \n Attention to your daily affairs in recent years has sometimes been limiting, but you\u2019re coming out of that phase, freeing you up for more interesting and even frivolous experiences from time to time. Still, developing more order or discipline with your outside interests, education, or sharing can be a rewarding path. \n More:  Leo 2025  \n More:  2025 Yearly  \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Leo \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Leo \n There are key changes in your solar chart in 2025 that suggest new attitudes and needs concerning committed partnerships, dear Leo, with Pluto now fully transitioned into the role of long-term guest in your partnership sector. \n Uranus rules your solar chart\u2019s partnership sector, and it\u2019s in Taurus and your career/reputation sector again this year, but only part-time.

It\u2019s a time to reach for new or redefined goals related to your life path. You are motivated to do your best or take the lead. \n Still, in the first half of the month, while there can be a flurry of activity, you don't necessarily have the personal energy to match, that is until Mars enters your sign on the 17th. You're more liable to make errors until then, but only if you are not listening to your body's signals to slow down. For the best results, do your best to keep up with opportunities, but don't push yourself to inhuman levels. Take the rest you need and pace yourself. \n Love is adventurous or spirited, and opportunities for financial gain often arise through a partner or the management of others' resources in June. Educational opportunities can open up from the 6th forward. Publishing or promotion can be in focus, and communications thrive. It's a time for feeling inspired, whether it\u2019s about your relationships, outlook, personal interests, or pleasing pastimes \u2014 or any combination of these! Aim high now, but not so high that you don\u2019t know where to begin. Your sign is all for reasonable and practical goals, so you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems with this. These themes are due to Venus in your solar ninth house--a supportive transit that gently encourages you and helps boost your popularity. \n It\u2019s also a time to see solutions to problems related to career or life path goals. You're hungry to learn new things and come to conclusions and resolutions! Transits facilitate conversations with people who can help you achieve your goals. It\u2019s a great time for optimism and hope or supportive news that excites you about your future. Who you know may be important now, but your positivity and confidence are key. \n The Full Moon on the 11th opens your eyes to a home or family matter. You may have been feeling stuck or in limbo, which can lead to an epiphany about your domestic world or the need for nurture, comfort, and safety. \n Mercury transits your social sector from the 8th to the 26th, increasing your attention to happiness goals, friendships, community involvement, and social activities. You could find yourself taking an interest in something entirely new now. The goals are to feel connected and contributing. \n Still, energy has been low recently with an extended stay of Mars in your privacy sector. As such, you may have had a hard time knowing how or where to focus your attention. However, with Mars entering your sign on the 17th, clarity comes. You are in take-charge mode, ready to take on a challenge, and willing to put yourself out to get where you want to go. This is also a powerful time for attracting romantic attention. \n Mars moving into your sign can feel like a nice rush, although it can overstimulate you at times, particularly if you don\u2019t have a goal to work toward. Still, it's a solid period for pursuing your plans and dreams and reanimating! You can be excited about your projects and personal interests. It\u2019s a time for taking the initiative, but do watch for oversized tempers. When you properly channel your energy during this transit, you are highly dynamic and creative. Even though your independence is in strong force, you\u2019re also in touch with others, especially once the Sun enters your social sector on the 20th. \n Saturn recently moved into your solar eighth house, where it will transit until September 1st. There will be a lengthy Part Two of this Saturn transit occurring from February 2026 to April 2028. During this cycle, if there's been dullness or routine in your intimate life, you'll want to do something about it. You may be dealing with some restricted support or resources from a partner, or there's more responsibility with your resources or in a relationship. This is a time for learning to rely more faithfully on your ability to make a living. You would do well to organize your finances and get a stronger sense of where you stand in terms of indebtedness and support, as circumstances are such that you want to tidy up in these areas. \n Another big planetary shift occurs from June 9th forward, and it lasts for over a year: Jupiter heads into your social sector. Social activity increases, or you\u2019re more interested in connecting with friends, networks, the community, or your higher goals, dreams, and plans. In the year ahead, you\u2019ll meet people and enjoy valuable connections during Jupiter\u2019s travels here. You\u2019re pinning your hopes on beautiful things, making mutually beneficial connections, and dreaming and planning for the future. You may meet acquaintances who help you further your goals, or you could join a new group or association that gives you considerable pleasure and satisfaction. \n At times this month, intimate relationships or an increased need for privacy or exclusiveness can impact friendships and social goals\u2013and vice versa! There can be challenges, such as power struggles or concerns about betrayal or boundaries. The desire to enjoy friendships and sharing is strong, but something or someone may hold you back or temporarily stand in your way. The key now is to look for ways to simplify your life, remembering that quality is more important than quantity in these areas. By simplifying your life, you can regain a sense of control. \n The last part of the month brings a surge in energy and initiative, which will carry over into July. You feel more than confident and happy to take the lead. While you\u2019re willing to move past obstacles now, there are fewer of them to deal with! Be as open, willing, positive, and faithful as feels comfortable. Something might inspire you to move forward on a personal goal, dream, or plan after the New Moon on the 25th. You suddenly see things as doable. There is some inclination to impulsiveness now with Mars in your sign, but if you are listening to gut instincts rather than simply reacting to people around you, then you\u2019re in good form. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n This Year: Virgo \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead brings the potential for growth with your social life, happiness goals, work, and reputation, dear Virgo. Particularly from February to June, you might enjoy positive exposure, promotion, or career recognition or growth. You are learning to \u201cown\u201d what you do and feeling more comfortable in a position of leadership or authority. At the same time, you\u2019re taking more pride in your home and family. \n June forward brings a new focus, a time when your social life blossoms. Through groups or friends, you might seek a sense of belonging and comfort, and you\u2019re likely to find it! It\u2019s also a time for new and exciting ideas for future growth and happiness. You\u2019re entertaining dreams of where you\u2019d like to go with your life, and while it was your professional life that you were more interested in in the first half of 2025, the focus is increasingly on personal happiness, ideals, and long-term goals in the second half. \n There can be a cause that you work towards enthusiastically, possibly related to family. Business income is likely to be strong. Patience and a sense of peace with what you have or what you want are with you now. Teaming up with others can figure strongly this year and bring real benefits to your life. This is not only about working with others, but about the potential for real benefits and growth that come from collaboration. You might connect with people who inspire you and motivate you to be your best simply because they see the best in you. \n The year is about blossoming and demanding a little more from your life, and you\u2019re likely to get it. Either you are moving toward identifying with a new path, or some changes are introduced to you, and rethinking things becomes necessary. Daily habits and routines are transforming again this year, and you have many opportunities to make meaningful changes. At the same time, your vision of your future, social standing, or career is morphing, especially if you\u2019ve felt confined or inauthentic in these life departments in the past. \n A long-term influence that has affected your partnerships for many years is nearing a close in 2025. This influence has likely brought some confusion, and possibly some disillusionment, to your relationships, and it\u2019s wrapping up. Your attractions and pleasures are changing. Love can be found or enhanced through your work, health pursuits, or passion projects. \n More:  Virgo 2025  \n See also:  2025 Virgo Preview Horoscope \n \n This Year in Love: Virgo \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Virgo \n The year 2025 features eclipses occurring in your sign and your partnership sector, dear Virgo, and you\u2019re exploring your identity and defining your needs from partnership. \n With the North Node moving into your partnership sector this year, there are great rewards and benefits (and perhaps some challenges) related to one-to-one relationships. The path to fulfillment involves recognizing your relationship needs. The challenge is to work on sensitizing yourself to the needs of others and to get over any fears of the demands a partner or significant people in your life might make on you. \n In fact, you continue to experience powerful eclipses \u2014 in 2025, these happen in your sign and your opposing sign \u2014 and they encourage you to make big decisions about how you live your life vis a vis partnerships. The first of this series occurred in September 2024, and the last will occur in February 2027. \n This year, a Lunar Eclipse occurs in your sign in March, signaling that it\u2019s time to change your image or redefine your personality in some manner. Finding a balance between autonomy and dependence is what this eclipse is about for you. Your emotions are on your sleeve. It is a good time to put your needs first, but doing so with respect for others will take you further. Whether you can succeed as a leader is \u201ctested\u201d right now. March looks to be a month of changes in yourself and an intimate relationship or your intimate world. \n Saturn is near the end of its transit of your opposite sign and partnership sector. The final date is February 13th, 2026. In 2025, Saturn continues here until May 24th and then from September 1st onward to February 13th, 2026. \n Neptune is on a similar path: Neptune is transitioning out of your opposite sign this year. But while Saturn was here since 2023, Neptune has been opposing your sign since 2011!\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Virgo Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty.

It\u2019s a time to reach for new or redefined goals related to your life path. You are motivated to do your best or take the lead. \n Still, in the first half of the month, while there can be a flurry of activity, you don't necessarily have the personal energy to match, that is until Mars enters your sign on the 17th. You're more liable to make errors until then, but only if you are not listening to your body's signals to slow down. For the best results, do your best to keep up with opportunities, but don't push yourself to inhuman levels. Take the rest you need and pace yourself. \n Love is adventurous or spirited, and opportunities for financial gain often arise through a partner or the management of others' resources in June. Educational opportunities can open up from the 6th forward. Publishing or promotion can be in focus, and communications thrive. It's a time for feeling inspired, whether it\u2019s about your relationships, outlook, personal interests, or pleasing pastimes \u2014 or any combination of these! Aim high now, but not so high that you don\u2019t know where to begin. Your sign is all for reasonable and practical goals, so you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems with this. These themes are due to Venus in your solar ninth house--a supportive transit that gently encourages you and helps boost your popularity. \n It\u2019s also a time to see solutions to problems related to career or life path goals. You're hungry to learn new things and come to conclusions and resolutions! Transits facilitate conversations with people who can help you achieve your goals. It\u2019s a great time for optimism and hope or supportive news that excites you about your future.

The challenge is to work on sensitizing yourself to the needs of others and to get over any fears of the demands a partner or significant people in your life might make on you. \n In fact, you continue to experience powerful eclipses \u2014 in 2025, these happen in your sign and your opposing sign \u2014 and they encourage you to make big decisions about how you live your life vis a vis partnerships. The first of this series occurred in September 2024, and the last will occur in February 2027. \n This year, a Lunar Eclipse occurs in your sign in March, signaling that it\u2019s time to change your image or redefine your personality in some manner. Finding a balance between autonomy and dependence is what this eclipse is about for you. Your emotions are on your sleeve. It is a good time to put your needs first, but doing so with respect for others will take you further. Whether you can succeed as a leader is \u201ctested\u201d right now. March looks to be a month of changes in yourself and an intimate relationship or your intimate world. \n Saturn is near the end of its transit of your opposite sign and partnership sector. The final date is February 13th, 2026. In 2025, Saturn continues here until May 24th and then from September 1st onward to February 13th, 2026. \n Neptune is on a similar path: Neptune is transitioning out of your opposite sign this year. But while Saturn was here since 2023, Neptune has been opposing your sign since 2011!\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Virgo Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty. Love, Annie (April 1, 2020)"

You'll find that everyday problem areas appear rather insignificant in comparison to the big picture. This is a strong month for relationship and intimacy' repair,' if necessary, and your personal magnetism is often fueled by your ability to bond and discuss personal matters this month. While there's increased activity and demand in the first half of June, the tempo changes considerably as the month advances, when ambitions are stirring, but personal energy levels may dip. \n New ideas and inspiration can be discovered through sharing and networking efforts. You\u2019re seeking something more meaningful or interesting to wrap your mind around. Energy flows particularly well for most mental and communicative matters. Your optimism can prompt you to consider something you never felt was in the realm of possibility. \n The month brings easy energy for studies, small adventures, and interesting happenings. Significant events are possible with friends or group associations. In the second half of the month, you\u2019re connecting more fully with your ambition, but you also recognize a strong need for a little space as Mars moves into your privacy sector. It\u2019s a time for perhaps rethinking some goals or drives but also for reorienting yourself and replenishing your energy stores. \n Venus transits your intimacy sector from the 6th forward, and you\u2019re inclined to tap into and explore your affections at their deepest level. You\u2019re skilled at getting the most out of situations and improving or deepening relationships now. This is a powerful time for helping others and encouraging them to make the most of their talents or otherwise thrive and enrich their lives. \n From the 8th to the 26th, Mercury transits your solar tenth house, and you\u2019ll find yourself adapting and adjusting in ways that benefit your career, reputation, status, or long-term goals. It\u2019s an intelligent and practical time. Besides calling upon your versatility and putting this trait to full use, it\u2019s a great time for bringing your knowledge, expertise, and intelligence to your professional or public life. You may be watching what you say more than usual now. You\u2019re a shock absorber of sorts during this transit as you take things in stride, mediate, and help everyone get along. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a sudden need to pay more attention to news and the goings-on close to home. Good news about a writing or learning assignment can come now, or your personal interests and projects can reach a turning point. If you\u2019ve been focusing too heavily on outside interests and neglecting your daily affairs, this Full Moon reminds you to balance your life. It\u2019s important to get on top of errands and paperwork now. \n Mars moving into your privacy sector on the 17th can slow you down a little, at least long enough to reassess recent activities, desires, and goals. If you've been overexerting yourself, you'll now need to observe some quiet time. Pacing yourself means everything with this transit! \n While there can be problems getting to the root of irritation or anger with Mars\u2019 transit through your solar twelfth house from the 17th forward, you can find much to enjoy as you attempt to understand your inner workings. Your actions in the real world may not seem as effective or they could go unnoticed, but self-knowledge helps you a lot and prepares you for the exciting transit of Mars through your sign from August 6th to September 22nd. You may be processing a lot, and not quite ready to make a big move or change until then. Be patient with this \u2014 it\u2019s an important process and a natural progression. \n Saturn has recently moved into your opposing sign, and this longer-term transit will be with you until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. You might be easing slowly but surely into a more committed, stable relationship, or you could be questioning your current relationship or relationship status. You\u2019ve recently learned to live a more structured life, and now, you\u2019re applying these things to your connections. \n This month, Jupiter makes its way to the top of your solar chart. While it does push for achievement, it also brings a sense of joy and meaning to your career pursuits. This influence is not fleeting, as Jupiter will bless your career and ambitions for over a year, until June 2026. This is big news, as Jupiter only makes a sign change every thirteen months or so! Your reputation is set to improve significantly this year. On the career front, there\u2019s potential for adventure and freedom. Whether you\u2019re more adventurous with your career or you enjoy more freedom with your work, this period is about growing your long-term goals and prospects. \n It\u2019s a time to discover more joy in following your ambitions and performing or excelling. Working towards a well-defined goal can be motivating and satisfying, although this goal may not be fully fleshed out just yet. Your position with bosses, parents, teachers, or authorities can improve wonderfully in the year ahead. Even so, you\u2019re making your own career opportunities with a confident attitude. \n Balancing your relationships or relationship goals with career goals and responsibilities to the outside world can be a challenge at times this month. These life departments clash or compete at the moment! A partner or significant person could question your ambitions or vie for your attention, competing with your special interest in your career or outside responsibilities. Others\u2019 expectations of you or their limits, rules, and critical observations can impact your performance. \n Business and career matters continue to pick up pace as the month advances, particularly from the 20th onward, when performance begins to matter more than it has in recent weeks. Brand new beginnings and projects related to business and finances are best left for the weeks following the New Moon on the 25th, but your efforts to connect with others and seek out advice can be very fruitful now. While you're a little more insular, you're also strongly motivated to take care of business. You have a wonderful sense of what people want. \n \u00a0 \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Libra \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead promises to be strong for direction, work, and business, dear Libra.

This is a strong month for relationship and intimacy' repair,' if necessary, and your personal magnetism is often fueled by your ability to bond and discuss personal matters this month. While there's increased activity and demand in the first half of June, the tempo changes considerably as the month advances, when ambitions are stirring, but personal energy levels may dip. \n New ideas and inspiration can be discovered through sharing and networking efforts. You\u2019re seeking something more meaningful or interesting to wrap your mind around. Energy flows particularly well for most mental and communicative matters. Your optimism can prompt you to consider something you never felt was in the realm of possibility. \n The month brings easy energy for studies, small adventures, and interesting happenings. Significant events are possible with friends or group associations. In the second half of the month, you\u2019re connecting more fully with your ambition, but you also recognize a strong need for a little space as Mars moves into your privacy sector. It\u2019s a time for perhaps rethinking some goals or drives but also for reorienting yourself and replenishing your energy stores. \n Venus transits your intimacy sector from the 6th forward, and you\u2019re inclined to tap into and explore your affections at their deepest level. You\u2019re skilled at getting the most out of situations and improving or deepening relationships now. This is a powerful time for helping others and encouraging them to make the most of their talents or otherwise thrive and enrich their lives. \n From the 8th to the 26th, Mercury transits your solar tenth house, and you\u2019ll find yourself adapting and adjusting in ways that benefit your career, reputation, status, or long-term goals. It\u2019s an intelligent and practical time. Besides calling upon your versatility and putting this trait to full use, it\u2019s a great time for bringing your knowledge, expertise, and intelligence to your professional or public life. You may be watching what you say more than usual now. You\u2019re a shock absorber of sorts during this transit as you take things in stride, mediate, and help everyone get along. \n The Full Moon on the 11th brings a sudden need to pay more attention to news and the goings-on close to home. Good news about a writing or learning assignment can come now, or your personal interests and projects can reach a turning point. If you\u2019ve been focusing too heavily on outside interests and neglecting your daily affairs, this Full Moon reminds you to balance your life. It\u2019s important to get on top of errands and paperwork now. \n Mars moving into your privacy sector on the 17th can slow you down a little, at least long enough to reassess recent activities, desires, and goals. If you've been overexerting yourself, you'll now need to observe some quiet time. Pacing yourself means everything with this transit! \n While there can be problems getting to the root of irritation or anger with Mars\u2019 transit through your solar twelfth house from the 17th forward, you can find much to enjoy as you attempt to understand your inner workings. Your actions in the real world may not seem as effective or they could go unnoticed, but self-knowledge helps you a lot and prepares you for the exciting transit of Mars through your sign from August 6th to September 22nd. You may be processing a lot, and not quite ready to make a big move or change until then. Be patient with this \u2014 it\u2019s an important process and a natural progression. \n Saturn has recently moved into your opposing sign, and this longer-term transit will be with you until September 1st and then from February 2026 to April 2028. You might be easing slowly but surely into a more committed, stable relationship, or you could be questioning your current relationship or relationship status. You\u2019ve recently learned to live a more structured life, and now, you\u2019re applying these things to your connections. \n This month, Jupiter makes its way to the top of your solar chart. While it does push for achievement, it also brings a sense of joy and meaning to your career pursuits. This influence is not fleeting, as Jupiter will bless your career and ambitions for over a year, until June 2026. This is big news, as Jupiter only makes a sign change every thirteen months or so! Your reputation is set to improve significantly this year. On the career front, there\u2019s potential for adventure and freedom. Whether you\u2019re more adventurous with your career or you enjoy more freedom with your work, this period is about growing your long-term goals and prospects. \n It\u2019s a time to discover more joy in following your ambitions and performing or excelling. Working towards a well-defined goal can be motivating and satisfying, although this goal may not be fully fleshed out just yet. Your position with bosses, parents, teachers, or authorities can improve wonderfully in the year ahead. Even so, you\u2019re making your own career opportunities with a confident attitude. \n Balancing your relationships or relationship goals with career goals and responsibilities to the outside world can be a challenge at times this month. These life departments clash or compete at the moment! A partner or significant person could question your ambitions or vie for your attention, competing with your special interest in your career or outside responsibilities. Others\u2019 expectations of you or their limits, rules, and critical observations can impact your performance. \n Business and career matters continue to pick up pace as the month advances, particularly from the 20th onward, when performance begins to matter more than it has in recent weeks. Brand new beginnings and projects related to business and finances are best left for the weeks following the New Moon on the 25th, but your efforts to connect with others and seek out advice can be very fruitful now. While you're a little more insular, you're also strongly motivated to take care of business. You have a wonderful sense of what people want. \n \u00a0 \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Libra \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead promises to be strong for direction, work, and business, dear Libra. Energies are robust for honing your skills and gaining experience, particularly in the first half of the year. As expansive Jupiter ascends to the top of your solar chart by June, it marks a personal peak that will accompany you for over a year, bringing a wave of growth and opportunity. \n You\u2019re opening your mind to new ideas and concepts this year. Favorable connections with people from distant places are on the horizon, and some of you may even find your voice reaching a wider audience. Embracing experiences with people from vastly different cultures can be a catalyst for personal growth and a source of profound insights. \n In the second half of the year, you\u2019ll have Jupiter reminding you that you deserve more and should reach for the stars, while Saturn has been encouraging you to consider essential details. You are also bringing more imagination to your work, and your intuition can serve you well. There will be times this year when you need to consciously push yourself to go after what you want. In the process, try to avoid worrying about coming across as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d. You\u00a0 are \u00a0these things \u2013 you don\u2019t need to prove it. You don\u2019t want to miss out on opportunities to advance out of fear of losing others\u2019 approval. In truth, this year is strong for building a solid reputation. \n The year may start with a slow, retrograde-ridden pace, but it also offers you the chance to review and reassess your current projects and goals. Despite the focus on achievement and performance in 2025, you\u2019ll find yourself investing more time, energy, and resources in your leisure, entertainment, and pastimes. Longer-term influences in your work and health sector are transitioning out, relieving some of the pressures on your everyday life. With this shift, more clarity and purpose will gradually but steadily come to you. \n Aim to use the power of Pluto to learn to love and value yourself more. In previous years, Pluto was in a sign that was incompatible with yours, and this has served to magnify some of your insecurities. Now that Pluto is harmonizing with your sign, harness its power to heal and strengthen by ridding yourself of attitudes and habits that make you feel less powerful\u2026 \n \n More:  2025 Libra  \n See also:  2025 Libra Preview Horoscope . \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Libra \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Libra \n Jupiter continues to transit your spirit and adventure sector until June 9th this year, dear Libra, and its harmony with your sign is strong for  reducing stress or boosting your outlook .

This influence adds a nice layer or padding to your very  spirit . It\u2019s not that changes won\u2019t get to you, but that you are taking things in stride\u2013you can see the big picture. \n Close relationships have been making headlines recently with the eclipses in your sign or your opposing sign. Partnering is changing! It\u2019s a time to first discover then balance your needs for independence and partnership. The set of eclipses responsible for this theme come to an end in 2025. On March 29th, the final Solar Eclipse in the set occurs in your partnership sector, and your needs from partnership are clear.

It's a fine time to strategize, as you're more inclined to examine and observe than to take definitive action. Debts and loans, financial backing, or a partner's income are bigger topics in June. You may address unhealthy dependencies and habits that hinder your growth. \n The month holds fantastic potential for your intimate life, emotional growth, significant career stirrings, and a growing focus on friends and happiness goals. \n The New Moon in late May offered you a shot in the arm to make positive lifestyle changes, and this energy is with you for much of June, so take advantage. There is also a strong focus on your close partnerships this month. Money matters, especially debt or shared resources, move forward. You are able to get the loan, support, or resources that you need, or you draw people into your life or inspire people you already know to enjoy the things that motivate you. Good energy is with you for research, learning, sharing ideas, and advancing your work interests. You might open your eyes wide to an intimate or personal matter, gain insight into someone\u2019s behavior, or find a solution to a problem that previously eluded you. This can be a time for coming to a satisfying agreement or deal involving money or support. \n But while you're often encouraged to dig deep, as the month progresses, a more social, connected theme emerges and then builds and strengthens. First, Venus enters your partnership sector on the 6th. This is a time for connecting with others, checking in with important people in your life, and honoring your close relationships. You\u2019re more willing to compromise and will go to great lengths to make things work. It\u2019s a beautiful time for building and enhancing your connections and, in some cases, attracting a new relationship or bringing a current one to a new level. Relationships, sharing time with others, and learning are especially in favor from the 6th forward. \n Next, you have Mercury entering your spirit sector (on the 8th)--an influence that stirs your desire to participate. Your vision shifts from deep to broad and wide. It's a positive cycle for sharing your ideas, learning new things, and building your knowledge. From the 17th, Mars moves into your social sector, and then on the 20th, the Sun heads into your spirit sector, too. The mood is light, sociable, energetic, and interactive. \n But first, the Full Moon on the 11th can bring up a mini financial crisis of sorts that stimulates positive change and, ultimately, a stronger feeling of control over your finances. Instead, this can signal a turning point in terms of money, respect, or comfort levels. You'll likely see a matter related to your income, financial situation, possessions, valuables, or sense of self-worth more clearly. You may have been feeling stuck or unable to make a move before this date, leading to an epiphany about your needs and wants. You\u2019re pushing through obstacles now. \n You've had Mars at the top of your solar chart for some time, stirring up both ambition and tension in varying degrees, but on the 17th, it moves on. You\u2019re ready to branch out and try new things now and will stop at nothing to pursue a cause you deem worthy. There is quite a bit of experimentation going on in your life this month. It's a good time for energizing teamwork or connecting with people to enjoy new experiences. \n You value your independence, but you\u2019re finding ways to enjoy and benefit from some level of collaboration with others. Friendships can be in good stead this month. The freer you are to do your own thing in your relationships, the better. \n Saturn recently began its long-term transit of your work and health sector, where it will transit until April 2028, although with a hiatus from September 2025 to February 2026. With this rather strict planet monitoring your daily routines, it's time to make critical changes in your daily habits. It has a strong influence on health improvement, cutting back, and healthier, more structured routines. A new position that requires more structure and effort or added chores and tasks can be in the spotlight. Discipline and a slow but steady approach work better than bold moves in these areas. You\u2019re called upon to develop more responsibility for your work and/or health. It\u2019s not an ideal period for recognition for your efforts, but what you\u2019re doing now can lay the groundwork for the future. \n This month, another big sign change occurs: Jupiter enters fellow Water sign, Cancer, and your solar ninth house. Jupiter has encouraged introspection and a deeper connection with your desires and needs in the last year. This spiritual regeneration begins to direct outward (from June 9th onward) as you seek to expand your mind, social circle, or activities with renewed faith in your powers to do so. \n Since Jupiter changes signs only once every year or so and transits a particular sign only every twelve years, Jupiter\u2019s move into your solar ninth house this month is big news. While its harmonious trine to your sign may be subtle at times in the year ahead, the results can be nothing short of fabulous. Your ability to communicate your ideas is improved multiple times over, and your popularity increases. You are an idea machine this year, and your hunches are spot on. This transit inspires a more adventurous and spirited approach to your world. \n Challenges can emerge if you\u2019re over-controlling your work, routine, and schedule or if these things become more demanding. You crave more time and energy to explore the world around you spontaneously, make contact with others, and expand your mind. However, you need to find a balance so that you can work and get your life into order, including your health, as chaotic schedules or too much on your plate can limit your more spontaneous activities. \n However, the last ten days of June are powerful for coming out of your shell and a more spirited attitude. Your recent tendency to dwell on problems or issues from the past is leaving you now. You're less likely to brood and more willing (and equipped) to make changes toward improvement. You gain emotional fuel. Making changes comes naturally because you're working with an open mind and responding to calls for spontaneity. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Scorpio \n \u00a0 \n 2025  Overview \n The year ahead is strong for passion projects, shared resources, intimacy, publishing, and connecting, dear Scorpio. Absorbing pursuits, deeper relationships, and exciting personal interests are in store. \n Until June, Jupiter is set to boost your financial and/or emotional support, especially from a partner or close friend. Your intimate world is rich. Combining your resources and talents with a partner can significantly improve your financial outlook. However, be prepared for potential changes in money from other sources as the year progresses. Fortunately, these surprises can bring detours that ultimately work in your favor. As you connect with your deeper desires and ambitions, your life path alters in interesting ways. \n The second half of the year is especially growth-oriented in more explicit, tangible ways. Benefits can come through long-distance experiences and people. Sharing beliefs can be a strong draw in your relationships, and your worldview expands in essential ways. It can be a wonderful period for connecting with others, even an audience, and both inspiring others and becoming inspired yourself. Your outlook is optimistic, especially with more rewarding pastimes and personal interests. \n You are looking for more from love \u2013 it\u2019s increasingly about intimacy in addition to mystical or romantic elements. You\u2019ve been attracting unusual, sometimes elusive or mysterious, people into your experience, but the astrological influence behind this long-term trend is on its way out. More stability on romantic and creative levels is on the horizon. \n It\u2019s important to be mindful of your body\u2019s needs for adequate rest, exercise, and nutrition this year. As you prioritize other pursuits, you may not always see these things clearly. Fundamental changes in how you approach your domestic world could be in the cards in 2025. An overhaul or purging could be worthwhile as you have different needs from your living arrangements. \n Deepening and expanding your knowledge can spark joy this year. It can also lead to meaningful experiences and adventures. Communication and transportation matters can improve, and new or better channels for connecting can expand your opportunities. \n More:  Scorpio 2025  \n See also  2025 Scorpio Preview \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Scorpio \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Scorpio \n Jupiter continues to ramp up the intimacy level of a relationship until June 9th this year, dear Scorpio. Extra attention to one-to-one connections continues, and with Jupiter, it\u2019s always about expansion. \n This transit can work magic on your intimate and sexual relationships. Sexual opportunities are likely to abound, or your focus on one partner becomes more expansive, warm, and close. With Uranus moving into this sector of your chart, there can sometimes be up-and-down energy and unpredictability. You\u2019ll be discovering or rediscovering your deeper desires. For now, it\u2019s an enjoyable experience. \n Some people with this transit go through a sexual renaissance of sorts. For others, this energy is about financial or emotional breakthroughs. \n A strong connection becomes stronger and closer, or your relationship with yourself improves. This influence opens your eyes to the beauty of intimate connection\u2013not that they were closed before, but new levels or depths of intimacy are uncovered. \n Jupiter brings abundance to the life, and sometimes it brings a little too much of a good thing, so it\u2019s possible that some Scorpios have more opportunities than they can reasonably manage! \n There may be a metamorphosis of sorts related to love, romance, or pleasure. It can be a significant period for\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Scorpio Love Horoscope \n \u00a0 \n \n   What\u2019s In Your Forecast? \n Take a peek at the year ahead with in-depth  Future Forecast Reports  from Cafe Astrology. \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty.

With this rather strict planet monitoring your daily routines, it's time to make critical changes in your daily habits. It has a strong influence on health improvement, cutting back, and healthier, more structured routines. A new position that requires more structure and effort or added chores and tasks can be in the spotlight. Discipline and a slow but steady approach work better than bold moves in these areas. You\u2019re called upon to develop more responsibility for your work and/or health. It\u2019s not an ideal period for recognition for your efforts, but what you\u2019re doing now can lay the groundwork for the future. \n This month, another big sign change occurs: Jupiter enters fellow Water sign, Cancer, and your solar ninth house. Jupiter has encouraged introspection and a deeper connection with your desires and needs in the last year. This spiritual regeneration begins to direct outward (from June 9th onward) as you seek to expand your mind, social circle, or activities with renewed faith in your powers to do so. \n Since Jupiter changes signs only once every year or so and transits a particular sign only every twelve years, Jupiter\u2019s move into your solar ninth house this month is big news. While its harmonious trine to your sign may be subtle at times in the year ahead, the results can be nothing short of fabulous. Your ability to communicate your ideas is improved multiple times over, and your popularity increases. You are an idea machine this year, and your hunches are spot on. This transit inspires a more adventurous and spirited approach to your world. \n Challenges can emerge if you\u2019re over-controlling your work, routine, and schedule or if these things become more demanding. You crave more time and energy to explore the world around you spontaneously, make contact with others, and expand your mind. However, you need to find a balance so that you can work and get your life into order, including your health, as chaotic schedules or too much on your plate can limit your more spontaneous activities. \n However, the last ten days of June are powerful for coming out of your shell and a more spirited attitude. Your recent tendency to dwell on problems or issues from the past is leaving you now. You're less likely to brood and more willing (and equipped) to make changes toward improvement. You gain emotional fuel. Making changes comes naturally because you're working with an open mind and responding to calls for spontaneity. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details",

Absorbing pursuits, deeper relationships, and exciting personal interests are in store. \n Until June, Jupiter is set to boost your financial and/or emotional support, especially from a partner or close friend. Your intimate world is rich. Combining your resources and talents with a partner can significantly improve your financial outlook.

As you connect with your deeper desires and ambitions, your life path alters in interesting ways. \n The second half of the year is especially growth-oriented in more explicit, tangible ways. Benefits can come through long-distance experiences and people. Sharing beliefs can be a strong draw in your relationships, and your worldview expands in essential ways. It can be a wonderful period for connecting with others, even an audience, and both inspiring others and becoming inspired yourself. Your outlook is optimistic, especially with more rewarding pastimes and personal interests. \n You are looking for more from love \u2013 it\u2019s increasingly about intimacy in addition to mystical or romantic elements. You\u2019ve been attracting unusual, sometimes elusive or mysterious, people into your experience, but the astrological influence behind this long-term trend is on its way out. More stability on romantic and creative levels is on the horizon. \n It\u2019s important to be mindful of your body\u2019s needs for adequate rest, exercise, and nutrition this year. As you prioritize other pursuits, you may not always see these things clearly. Fundamental changes in how you approach your domestic world could be in the cards in 2025. An overhaul or purging could be worthwhile as you have different needs from your living arrangements. \n Deepening and expanding your knowledge can spark joy this year.

            "forecast": "Specials \n \u00a0 \n This Month: Scorpio \n June 2025 Monthly Horoscope Overview for Scorpio: \n In the first three weeks of June, you can be more introspective and often absorbed in your special pursuits, dear Scorpio. It's a fine time to strategize, as you're more inclined to examine and observe than to take definitive action. Debts and loans, financial backing, or a partner's income are bigger topics in June. You may address unhealthy dependencies and habits that hinder your growth. \n The month holds fantastic potential for your intimate life, emotional growth, significant career stirrings, and a growing focus on friends and happiness goals. \n The New Moon in late May offered you a shot in the arm to make positive lifestyle changes, and this energy is with you for much of June, so take advantage. There is also a strong focus on your close partnerships this month. Money matters, especially debt or shared resources, move forward. You are able to get the loan, support, or resources that you need, or you draw people into your life or inspire people you already know to enjoy the things that motivate you. Good energy is with you for research, learning, sharing ideas, and advancing your work interests. You might open your eyes wide to an intimate or personal matter, gain insight into someone\u2019s behavior, or find a solution to a problem that previously eluded you. This can be a time for coming to a satisfying agreement or deal involving money or support. \n But while you're often encouraged to dig deep, as the month progresses, a more social, connected theme emerges and then builds and strengthens. First, Venus enters your partnership sector on the 6th. This is a time for connecting with others, checking in with important people in your life, and honoring your close relationships. You\u2019re more willing to compromise and will go to great lengths to make things work. It\u2019s a beautiful time for building and enhancing your connections and, in some cases, attracting a new relationship or bringing a current one to a new level. Relationships, sharing time with others, and learning are especially in favor from the 6th forward. \n Next, you have Mercury entering your spirit sector (on the 8th)--an influence that stirs your desire to participate. Your vision shifts from deep to broad and wide. It's a positive cycle for sharing your ideas, learning new things, and building your knowledge. From the 17th, Mars moves into your social sector, and then on the 20th, the Sun heads into your spirit sector, too. The mood is light, sociable, energetic, and interactive. \n But first, the Full Moon on the 11th can bring up a mini financial crisis of sorts that stimulates positive change and, ultimately, a stronger feeling of control over your finances. Instead, this can signal a turning point in terms of money, respect, or comfort levels. You'll likely see a matter related to your income, financial situation, possessions, valuables, or sense of self-worth more clearly. You may have been feeling stuck or unable to make a move before this date, leading to an epiphany about your needs and wants. You\u2019re pushing through obstacles now. \n You've had Mars at the top of your solar chart for some time, stirring up both ambition and tension in varying degrees, but on the 17th, it moves on. You\u2019re ready to branch out and try new things now and will stop at nothing to pursue a cause you deem worthy. There is quite a bit of experimentation going on in your life this month. It's a good time for energizing teamwork or connecting with people to enjoy new experiences. \n You value your independence, but you\u2019re finding ways to enjoy and benefit from some level of collaboration with others. Friendships can be in good stead this month. The freer you are to do your own thing in your relationships, the better. \n Saturn recently began its long-term transit of your work and health sector, where it will transit until April 2028, although with a hiatus from September 2025 to February 2026.

During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty.

One-to-one connections can be an arena for self-understanding. It's a time to make compromises, cooperate, and interact as you put some of your personal goals and interests on hold. It's also a time for seeking out counsel and companionship. \n You are more able to focus your energy in the last week of the month, but until then, your social life continues to take top priority. Your attention is often divided. Breaks from the usual routine are especially desirable now, as you are in need of a change of scenery. Getting your love life into order is a strong theme in June. Your willingness to listen to and support a partner is key. Socially, people see you in a positive light. Conversations with people you care about can be extra special, as they can help you see your feelings and ideas more clearly. \n Even if your relationship situation seems unchanged on the surface, this is a time for revelations and contemplations about your needs, wants, and intimacy. It's a period of potential growth and evolution, a time to assess whether you\u2019re growing and evolving through and with significant others in your life. Since the New Moon in May, you're motivated through most of June to improve relationships or to seek out a lasting bond with someone. It\u2019s a time for reaching for new or redefined goals related to a partnership, and something is building, evolving, and strengthening. It\u2019s a wonderful period for connecting with others in valuable, rewarding ways. \n June certainly features a social theme, but your attention often turns to work, career, business, health, and other practical affairs, and this increases as the month advances. First, Venus heads into your work and health sector on the 6th, and your focus on bringing harmony to your daily routines can be fruitful. You\u2019re enjoying your daily life. You can turn even complex tasks into fun exercises now. You might connect with companions or friends through your routines, work, or pursuit of wellness. \n Next, Mercury heads into your intimacy sector on the 8th, where it will visit until the 26th. This transit encourages making plans and formulating strategies rather than jumping into action. It\u2019s a good time to talk through usually complicated matters or to mediate and negotiate better relations, finances, support, and life strategies. You may be doing more troubleshooting than usual, and you\u2019re very successful at the task! On the 17th, Mars makes it to the peak of your solar chart, firing up your ambitions to perform. With this combination of Mars here and Venus and Mercury now in the background areas of your solar chart, your business intelligence is through the roof, making the second half of June particularly strong for working productively and getting to the bottom of matters. The Sun heads into your intimacy sector on the 20th, solidifying these themes. \n In the days surrounding the Full Moon in your sign on the 11th, previously buried emotions surface, possibly in a raw way. Long-standing problems or projects can come to fruition. A relationship matter might suddenly reveal itself, or a personal revelation can occur. It's an eyes-wide-open time regarding a matter related to your personal goals, personality, health, outlook, and independence or initiative. A sense of being stuck can lead to an epiphany about your true feelings on a matter. \n You're super motivated with Mars moving through your ambition sector from the 17th. A strong focus on career goals or increased responsibilities and workloads is likely. You may be feeling pressured, but the adjustments you make as a result will dramatically improve your potential for success. It's one of the most active periods of the year for goal chasing, and this Mars cycle lasts until the first week of August. Luckily, your drive matches your ambition. Your enterprising spirit awakens, as you are not so content with doing the same things, as comforting as that may be. There should be some caution when it comes to defying authority, but overall, it's a great time to strive for improvement, meet or exceed your goals, and showcase your leadership qualities. \n While exciting for life path goals, you can sometimes feel that you\u2019re in the hot seat with Mars challenging your sign during this transit. You do prefer a more straightforward approach to life than what\u2019s offered you now, but you can work with this energy and use it to your advantage, laying the groundwork for more outgoing times to come. \n Saturn moved into your sector of joy in late May, where it will transit until April 2028, with a hiatus from September 2025 to February 2026. This transit can introduce the idea that you may need to cut back on certain pleasures and hobbies or bring more structure to your leisure time. Hobbies might turn into work, love becomes a little more serious, and there may be fewer avenues for leisure open to you. With Saturn moving away from your family and home sector, responsibilities and pressures decrease on the domestic front. Saturn here challenges you to discipline your creative expression, and you can be more practical or cautious with the pursuit of love and pleasure. \n This month, Jupiter moves into your solar sector of joint finances, intimacy, and transformation, and the year ahead is a power period on a financial level. Support from others is a strong potential. Regarding intimacy, your ability (and desire) for more profound levels of experience dominates. Superficial connections won\u2019t do! You get the opportunity to derive real satisfaction and enjoyment from your relationships during this transit that\u2019s with you until the end of June 2026. \n This Jupiter transit might release you from a debt or dependency, or if you\u2019ve kept to yourself and now need support in the form of loans or backing, this could be the time when you get what you need. It\u2019s a time to sort out your debt or joint finances. You\u2019re determined to get a hold on your life, perhaps through tackling bad habits, addictions, or negative attitudes that may have been undermining your confidence. Happily, opportunities emerge to do so. \n You\u2019re in great shape for deepened relationships or more joy in an intimate relationship. Your relationship with yourself can grow as you understand your deeper needs more fully and embrace the more hidden elements of your nature. Combining your resources, whether this is about money, time, or talents, can bring rich rewards. \n Certainly, your expectations from\u2013and attitudes toward\u2013romance, entertainment, children, or creative expression are shifting. New ways of expressing yourself or restrictions on your expressiveness and leisure activities could pressure or strain a relationship. You may be torn between wanting more or less from a relationship, but you're also learning much about yourself and your needs. \n The last week of the month brings increased energy and motivation to manage your finances. More activity, clarity, and ambition with your life-plan goals or career can also be prominent now. You may have the opportunity to collect on a debt or settle one after the New Moon on the 25th. Plus, Mercury heads into harmony with your sign on the 26th, and communication improves. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Sagittarius in 2025 \n The year ahead brings rewarding experiences with others and special attention to passion projects, dear Sagittarius. While close relationships are in strong focus this year, Sagittarians can be a little more private and introspective than usual in 2025. You might meet somebody who deepens your intimate life in remarkable ways, opening you up to new ways of expressing yourself, or if already attached, you might deepen your relationship similarly. New depths (and heights) can be experienced now and add to your inner glow. Love matters should be quite strong this year, with significant partnerships a great focus. \n Partnerships fare better than more casual love relationships, the latter being a little more complicated as your needs from these connections evolve. Even so, you\u2019re receiving Uranus as a guest in your partnership sector for part of 2025. This planet will soon set up shop in this area of your solar chart for years to come, changing up partnering experiences and needs. In truth, the dynamics of close partnerships (personal and business ones) begin shifting. This year, you\u2019re exploring matters of freedom, happiness, and growth in your relationships\u2013stale, overly rigid, and dull patterns stick out like a sore thumb now. \n Financial support in the form of loans or shared resources tends to be easier to come by from June forward, but it will be essential to watch your borrowing habits. There can be good publicity this year, and your ability to meet others halfway (often further) opens up social possibilities and opportunities. You are generous by nature with your ruling planet, expansive Jupiter. With Jupiter moving through two sectors of your chart associated with partners and close friends, you are directing much of this generosity to significant others in 2025. Enjoy yourself as you do, but watch for overblown expectations or promises that may be hard to keep later. \n Communication and learning are areas of evolution and change. Your powers of influence run exceptionally high \u2013 others are truly listening to what you have to say. You may also find great pleasure in research or other serious study. Living conditions improve as both Saturn and Neptune transition out of your home and family sector, helping simplify and clarify your domestic world. \n See the  2025 Yearly Sagittarius Horoscope  or the  2025 Sagittarius Preview Horoscope \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Sagittarius \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Sagittarius \n With your ruling planet, Jupiter, in your partnership and intimacy sectors this year, dear Sagittarius, relationships are a major headline in 2025. \n Until June 9th, Jupiter continues to bless your one-to-one relationships. It\u2019s a powerful period for attracting or enhancing a key relationship. \n This booster Jupiter transit brings growth and expansion to your close partnerships from May 25th, 2024, to June 9th, 2025. It\u2019s a commitment-friendly period in which partnering tends to  bring much joy . You see the pleasant side of others. \n Jupiter\u2019s transits are where you find your joy and, during this period, it\u2019s very often through a significant other. New partners met now are likely to feel much like a breath of fresh air. Challenging relationships or challenges in relationships tend to be left behind for the most part during this trend. You attract happy and empowering circumstances and people into your life. \n A new best friend or partner can be in focus. Instead, you\u2019re enhancing an existing close relationship. While Jupiter is considered a lucky transit, it\u2019s actually less about luck than it is about  magnification  and  expansion .

One-to-one connections can be an arena for self-understanding. It's a time to make compromises, cooperate, and interact as you put some of your personal goals and interests on hold. It's also a time for seeking out counsel and companionship. \n You are more able to focus your energy in the last week of the month, but until then, your social life continues to take top priority. Your attention is often divided. Breaks from the usual routine are especially desirable now, as you are in need of a change of scenery. Getting your love life into order is a strong theme in June. Your willingness to listen to and support a partner is key. Socially, people see you in a positive light. Conversations with people you care about can be extra special, as they can help you see your feelings and ideas more clearly. \n Even if your relationship situation seems unchanged on the surface, this is a time for revelations and contemplations about your needs, wants, and intimacy. It's a period of potential growth and evolution, a time to assess whether you\u2019re growing and evolving through and with significant others in your life. Since the New Moon in May, you're motivated through most of June to improve relationships or to seek out a lasting bond with someone. It\u2019s a time for reaching for new or redefined goals related to a partnership, and something is building, evolving, and strengthening. It\u2019s a wonderful period for connecting with others in valuable, rewarding ways. \n June certainly features a social theme, but your attention often turns to work, career, business, health, and other practical affairs, and this increases as the month advances. First, Venus heads into your work and health sector on the 6th, and your focus on bringing harmony to your daily routines can be fruitful. You\u2019re enjoying your daily life. You can turn even complex tasks into fun exercises now. You might connect with companions or friends through your routines, work, or pursuit of wellness. \n Next, Mercury heads into your intimacy sector on the 8th, where it will visit until the 26th. This transit encourages making plans and formulating strategies rather than jumping into action. It\u2019s a good time to talk through usually complicated matters or to mediate and negotiate better relations, finances, support, and life strategies. You may be doing more troubleshooting than usual, and you\u2019re very successful at the task! On the 17th, Mars makes it to the peak of your solar chart, firing up your ambitions to perform. With this combination of Mars here and Venus and Mercury now in the background areas of your solar chart, your business intelligence is through the roof, making the second half of June particularly strong for working productively and getting to the bottom of matters. The Sun heads into your intimacy sector on the 20th, solidifying these themes. \n In the days surrounding the Full Moon in your sign on the 11th, previously buried emotions surface, possibly in a raw way. Long-standing problems or projects can come to fruition. A relationship matter might suddenly reveal itself, or a personal revelation can occur. It's an eyes-wide-open time regarding a matter related to your personal goals, personality, health, outlook, and independence or initiative. A sense of being stuck can lead to an epiphany about your true feelings on a matter. \n You're super motivated with Mars moving through your ambition sector from the 17th. A strong focus on career goals or increased responsibilities and workloads is likely. You may be feeling pressured, but the adjustments you make as a result will dramatically improve your potential for success. It's one of the most active periods of the year for goal chasing, and this Mars cycle lasts until the first week of August. Luckily, your drive matches your ambition. Your enterprising spirit awakens, as you are not so content with doing the same things, as comforting as that may be. There should be some caution when it comes to defying authority, but overall, it's a great time to strive for improvement, meet or exceed your goals, and showcase your leadership qualities. \n While exciting for life path goals, you can sometimes feel that you\u2019re in the hot seat with Mars challenging your sign during this transit. You do prefer a more straightforward approach to life than what\u2019s offered you now, but you can work with this energy and use it to your advantage, laying the groundwork for more outgoing times to come. \n Saturn moved into your sector of joy in late May, where it will transit until April 2028, with a hiatus from September 2025 to February 2026. This transit can introduce the idea that you may need to cut back on certain pleasures and hobbies or bring more structure to your leisure time. Hobbies might turn into work, love becomes a little more serious, and there may be fewer avenues for leisure open to you. With Saturn moving away from your family and home sector, responsibilities and pressures decrease on the domestic front. Saturn here challenges you to discipline your creative expression, and you can be more practical or cautious with the pursuit of love and pleasure. \n This month, Jupiter moves into your solar sector of joint finances, intimacy, and transformation, and the year ahead is a power period on a financial level. Support from others is a strong potential. Regarding intimacy, your ability (and desire) for more profound levels of experience dominates. Superficial connections won\u2019t do! You get the opportunity to derive real satisfaction and enjoyment from your relationships during this transit that\u2019s with you until the end of June 2026. \n This Jupiter transit might release you from a debt or dependency, or if you\u2019ve kept to yourself and now need support in the form of loans or backing, this could be the time when you get what you need. It\u2019s a time to sort out your debt or joint finances. You\u2019re determined to get a hold on your life, perhaps through tackling bad habits, addictions, or negative attitudes that may have been undermining your confidence. Happily, opportunities emerge to do so. \n You\u2019re in great shape for deepened relationships or more joy in an intimate relationship. Your relationship with yourself can grow as you understand your deeper needs more fully and embrace the more hidden elements of your nature. Combining your resources, whether this is about money, time, or talents, can bring rich rewards. \n Certainly, your expectations from\u2013and attitudes toward\u2013romance, entertainment, children, or creative expression are shifting. New ways of expressing yourself or restrictions on your expressiveness and leisure activities could pressure or strain a relationship. You may be torn between wanting more or less from a relationship, but you're also learning much about yourself and your needs. \n The last week of the month brings increased energy and motivation to manage your finances. More activity, clarity, and ambition with your life-plan goals or career can also be prominent now. You may have the opportunity to collect on a debt or settle one after the New Moon on the 25th. Plus, Mercury heads into harmony with your sign on the 26th, and communication improves. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details",

While close relationships are in strong focus this year, Sagittarians can be a little more private and introspective than usual in 2025.

New depths (and heights) can be experienced now and add to your inner glow.

You are generous by nature with your ruling planet, expansive Jupiter. With Jupiter moving through two sectors of your chart associated with partners and close friends, you are directing much of this generosity to significant others in 2025.

You can be busy taking care of day-to-day affairs, work projects, and health pursuits. Life seems to call on you to deal with the details and practical side of everyday life, become more organized, and take charge of your routines. You can enjoy following goals and plans that help you get back on track physically and mentally. \n In many ways, June is a month of getting your life into order and more balanced, most specifically through managing health, lifestyle, work, and daily routines, and later in June, through different perspectives. You are taking more interest and pride in your work or contributions. You might thoroughly enjoy doing some form of research and analysis, making lists, and gathering information that helps you get a handle on your daily affairs. \n The month does become lighter as it moves forward, but you\u2019re in a good position to dig up and handle problems that will help you move onward and forward! \n In the meantime, the inner planets are slowly but surely moving into social areas of your chart, and your mood shifts accordingly. First, Venus heads into your creativity sector on the 6th. While you should watch for a tendency to make decisions based on the desire for others\u2019 appreciation or approval, once kept in check, it\u2019s a wonderful time for exploring your creative side and allowing it to shine. You can turn your desire for approval to your advantage and use it to motivate you to improve as well as express yourself and share your creations and feelings. \n As such, romance and entertainment are very often where your heart is from the 6th forward. It\u2019s a great time for dating, recreation, and pastimes. You often find support for your creative pursuits, negotiations, relationships, romance, contracts, mergers, children, hobbies, and partnerships. At the same time, your mind is on work and practical matters, getting fit (or fitter!), and taking care of important details, making a nice balance between work and play a strong potential. \n Second, Mercury moves into your partnership sector on the 8th, where it will visit until the 26th. You see your life in new ways as others offer you their perspective. You learn about yourself through conversations and companionship during this transit. It\u2019s a good time to pair up with someone, and your desire for mental companionship and cooperation can lead to interesting connections and experiences. Next up, Mars moves into your spirit sector from the 17th, and then the Sun begins its stay in your partnership sector on the 20th. All signs point to a more involved, connected, and sociable time as June advances. \n But first, a Full Moon occurs on the 11th, and a sudden need for your time or services could emerge, or a private matter can now come to light. Even though you may be feeling tired, don't leave all the decision-making up to someone else. This Full Moon can illuminate a matter related to your need for rest, downtime, and release from the past, stress, and pressure. Your intuition has a lot to tell you now, and it\u2019s wise to pay it mind! \n Mars moves into your adventure sector on the 17th after an extended stay in your solar eighth house. You're more courageous and active, making your own happiness rather than waiting for it to come to you! Mars fires up your desire to get a little more from your life. You can be ardently pursuing a new passion or interest. \n Saturn recently began its transit of your solar fourth house, where it will visit until April 2028 (with a hiatus from September 2025 to February 2026). Increased responsibilities with family are likely, but you can feel more accomplished as you meet them. Look for problem areas in the home and family unit and get a jump start on fixing them since they\u2019re bound to emerge in the coming years. Domestic matters require more serious thought, self-discipline, and organization. Whether you realize a home-owning dream or decide it's not yet time, or you turn your attention to bringing more order to your family or domestic world, there can be new responsibilities and pressures but also rewards, even if they are delayed. \n Saturn\u2019s transit of your solar third house in recent years may have limited your responsiveness to social contact, and although there\u2019s a little more of it to come from September 2025 to February 2026, this influence is on its way out. \n This month, Jupiter, the planet of expansion, works magic on your close partnerships and relationships as it moves into your solar seventh house on the 9th. This transit lasts until the end of June 2026 and emphasizes a relationship with someone special. Negotiations, counseling, advising, and work with the public are in favor. You\u2019ll have opportunities to expand your horizons and enjoy or benefit from your connections more than ever. \n In the year ahead, resolving long-standing problems in existing relationships or embarking on a new relationship can figure strongly. You are well-received and incredibly likable during this transit. You seem to attract people and situations that benefit your personal growth. There can be someone who has an unusually encouraging and positive effect on you. \n Enthusiasm stirred up in the last week of the month can take you far. You may be seeking to feel more alive, vital, and vibrant through interactions with others or in relationships. While you\u2019re feeling motivated, you\u2019re not inclined to go into overdrive, and this is a good thing. Steady energy helps you get things done. If you need a fresh start of sorts when it comes to a partnership, look to the week following the New Moon that occurs on the 25th. You tend to attract strong and intelligent people into your life, and you take more pride in your close relationships. \n More: \n Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n More Daily Horoscopes \u2013 All Zodiac Signs: \n Select a Sign Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Capricorn \n 2025  Overview \n The year 2025 brings a fuller social life to your world, dear Capricorn.\u00a0 There\u2019s less pressure to prove yourself or perform this year, and more joy in plugging away at what you do best. Until June, watch that you don\u2019t overload your life with additional responsibilities. Otherwise, it\u2019s a strong period for truly enjoying your daily life and routines. Work should be quite available to you. While relationships with family can grow to be more demanding, 2025 is a year in which you are reminded how much you need others. Jupiter\u2019s presence in your opposing sign (Cancer) from June 9th forward is likely to bring helpful, happy people into your experience and, for some, a partner who deepens your happiness. Existing partnerships can bring joy. \n Overall health may improve, and wellness routines can spark joy this year. Communications are becoming far less pressured, and learning or personal interests and connecting can bring rewards. \n \n With Saturn transitioning into your solar fourth house this year, there can be times when you feel the walls are closing in on you with home or family. There can be a feeling of heaviness when it comes to your responsibilities or you literally feel cramped in your personal space. However, you have the chance to restructure your domestic world by bringing more order to it. But while Saturn wants you to be more organized in your home life, Neptune encourages you to bring more imagination to the equation. Uranus, too, is changing, and it asks for a more authentic approach to your routines and job. A more unconventional approach to your work or daily duties can be in store. Fortunately, you\u2019re able to create harmonious conditions that boost both your work and home life considerably. \n You can be very resourceful when it comes to recycling or using what you already own in different ways. You might find unique products to sell and market. Shifts in the distribution and sources of income are also likely this year. Partnerships may get off to a bit of a rocky start this year, but they improve many times over as 2025 advances, especially with better communication. \n More:  Capricorn 2025   or   \u2013\u00a0 2025 Preview \n \n \n This Year in Love: Capricorn \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Capricorn \n With your ruler, Saturn, transitioning into a new sign and Pluto now permanently out of your sign, dear Capricorn, it\u2019s an interesting year of discovery.

This one-year transit brings you delightful opportunities and benefits on a social level, particularly for one-on-one relationships. Many Capricorns will gain a new best friend or partner during this cycle that lasts from June 2025 to June 2026, and others will expand and enhance an existing close relationship. \n Jupiter is generally considered a lucky transit, but it\u2019s probably less about luck and more about magnification and expansion.

You can be busy taking care of day-to-day affairs, work projects, and health pursuits. Life seems to call on you to deal with the details and practical side of everyday life, become more organized, and take charge of your routines. You can enjoy following goals and plans that help you get back on track physically and mentally. \n In many ways, June is a month of getting your life into order and more balanced, most specifically through managing health, lifestyle, work, and daily routines, and later in June, through different perspectives. You are taking more interest and pride in your work or contributions. You might thoroughly enjoy doing some form of research and analysis, making lists, and gathering information that helps you get a handle on your daily affairs. \n The month does become lighter as it moves forward, but you\u2019re in a good position to dig up and handle problems that will help you move onward and forward! \n In the meantime, the inner planets are slowly but surely moving into social areas of your chart, and your mood shifts accordingly. First, Venus heads into your creativity sector on the 6th. While you should watch for a tendency to make decisions based on the desire for others\u2019 appreciation or approval, once kept in check, it\u2019s a wonderful time for exploring your creative side and allowing it to shine. You can turn your desire for approval to your advantage and use it to motivate you to improve as well as express yourself and share your creations and feelings. \n As such, romance and entertainment are very often where your heart is from the 6th forward. It\u2019s a great time for dating, recreation, and pastimes. You often find support for your creative pursuits, negotiations, relationships, romance, contracts, mergers, children, hobbies, and partnerships. At the same time, your mind is on work and practical matters, getting fit (or fitter!), and taking care of important details, making a nice balance between work and play a strong potential. \n Second, Mercury moves into your partnership sector on the 8th, where it will visit until the 26th. You see your life in new ways as others offer you their perspective. You learn about yourself through conversations and companionship during this transit.

Even so, it's a powerful time to attack your \"to-do\" list. The month is strong for family, romance, creativity, and work. The month is electric for your relationships on some levels. Still, with Venus in your sector of heart and home from the 6th onward, you're also a bit self-protective with your feelings even though you are generally willing to enjoy yourself. \n Much of the month, passions are strong, and a partner can be more active, assertive, or temperamental than usual. You're ready to attack problems from the root rather than falling back on quick bandaid fixes. You have real admirers this month. Recreation, leisure activities, hobbies, and entertainment are in strong focus. You can be motivated to share ideas, affection, or entertainment with others. Fun interests and opportunities to enjoy yourself can emerge, and you appreciate the extra warmth and positivity in your interactions. Enjoying yourself and celebrating may be in order now. \n With your sector of joy activated, a lighter, less burdened feeling is with you. You are discovering your inner muse and embarking on a fresh start in your creative pursuits. Although your love life is likely to be changeable, good things are happening, and others are finding you especially easy to be around. Romance is full-on in June for some, with lively conversations and much stimulation. Problems in relationships are readily aired. Fortunately, you have all the skills at your disposal to iron out differences. \n An introspective turn emerges slowly but surely as the month advances, starting with Venus heading into your home and family sector on the 6th. This is the first and perhaps the strongest hint that you need some personal time. While you may want to watch for playing it a little too safe for your own good now, it\u2019s a powerful period for finding your emotional center and getting in touch with your needs for safety, nurture, and security. There can be fresh starts with a family member, a new or improved relationship with someone close to you, or happier, more supportive living conditions. \n Mars in your partnership and then intimacy sectors this month can definitely heat up and animate your closest relationships. While some may face difficulties with an overbearing partner, this is a good time to make changes and alleviate some of the building tension. This period favors confronting problems head-on with direct and assertive Mars involved. \n The Full Moon on the 11th can open your eyes (or perhaps more aptly, your heart) to a need for friendship, a feeling of belonging to something bigger than yourself, a satisfying social life, or a desire to contribute. You may have been feeling stuck with your current pursuits or overwhelmed with things to do, and this frustration can lead to an epiphany about your true feelings on a matter. Expect a rush of emotions and perhaps surprising epiphanies as you awaken to needs you may have been suppressing. It's a time to confront feelings. \n From the 17th forward, you\u2019re in a particularly good position to observe and strategize your next moves. After an extended stay in your partnership sector, Mars moves into your intimacy sector, pulling you into your own head or more deeply into a relationship or special project. While exciting on many levels, this is not the most comfortable place for Mars, and it can sometimes feel difficult to assert yourself directly or straightforwardly during this cycle. It is useful, however, for digging things up and stirring up passions and desires you may have ignored or buried. \n With Saturn now transiting your communications sector, you're challenged to channel your energies more constructively. This transit is a longer-term event, running until September 1st this year and then continuing from February 2026 to April 2028. In the period ahead, you might take up structured learning or bring more discipline to your work or studies. You tend to communicate with more authority, and with more focus and structure, you can become quite skilled at a particular subject. Some distancing yourself from others might occur with new interests and responsibilities, however. \n It\u2019s a supportive transit overall\u2013one in which you\u2019re more able to meet your obligations. You\u2019re keeping your cool! Life feels more stable. It\u2019s a fine time for learning better concentration and the ability to listen and absorb lessons/information. You\u2019re developing mental discipline and organization. \n This month, Jupiter moves into a new area of your solar chart, where it will transit for over a year (until June 2026). It's a significant development that will expand the nature and scope of your daily activities and routines. You\u2019ll discover more meaning and joy in your work or daily affairs. Opportunities for improved working conditions and advancement are likely. Your positive attitude toward your job or duties could play a key role in attracting these opportunities and potential windfalls. You might also enjoy a stronger interest in nutrition, cleaner living, and fitness. You\u2019ll find new ways to manage and improve your daily life, but there can be some initial dissatisfaction before you feel the drive to make improvements and refinements. \n However, there can be a clash between your increased desire to pursue work and health activities and your responsibilities to others or special projects and personal interests. It can be challenging to juggle all that you have going on at this time! As best as you can, aim to get a handle on your priorities to navigate these areas. \n Work and health improvements are in the works as June advances, especially after the New Moon on the 25th, setting the tone for the few weeks ahead. You are well-positioned to make lifestyle changes, improve your habits, and find more meaning and happiness in your work. \n Even before this New Moon, however, the practical side of life takes on increasing importance, with Mercury in your work and health sector from the 8th to the 26th and the Sun there from the 20th onward. This a brilliant time for making lists and plans, getting organized, and taking care of business. The focus should be on improving your daily life and habits, and you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities and motivation to do so. Tame the inclination to take on too much, and you\u2019ll be in great shape to get your life into better working order. \n These influences encourage good (and smart) work habits as well as special attention to the small things that make your world go \u2019round! This can be a time of addressing minor issues and ensuring your routines work for you, not against you. It\u2019s an excellent time for honing skills and learning useful things. You\u2019ll find yourself with more energy to invest in work, organizing your personal environment, and health routines. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Detail \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Aquarius \n You are working harder this year at communicating more effectively and building your level of expertise, dear Aquarius. In 2025, you will delve deep into your true motives and feelings about practical matters, with the potential to make significant changes in your work life. While the steps you take may not be giant or quick, they can lead to a better understanding of what you can and want to do in your work. At the same time, there\u2019s an edgier quality to your personality, which can subtly change your relationships and pursuits. \n Not everyone knows this about your sign, but you take your career, income, and service to others to heart. You need to feel good on a deep level about what you do in order to feel good about yourself. The focus this year is on really enjoying what you do. Although work can bring joy, it can also involve some challenges. Be sure to carefully discriminate what you take on with new work or projects. Fortunately, this year can bring opportunities to your door, especially for work and reputation boosts. \n But 2025 is certainly not all about work, especially until June when new avenues for entertainment and self-expression open up to you. All year, you are working on growing past stubborn attitudes and beliefs, communicating more mindfully, and changing deeply ingrained habits and systems. \n You are becoming quite dissatisfied with sloppy learning or holes in your thinking and want to refine your skills and knowledge this year. There is more of this energy next year and beyond, but you\u2019re getting a taste of it now. Financially speaking, you are moving away from a spiritual, somewhat passive approach and towards a more active, slightly more risk-taking approach to making money. You will no longer sit back and wait for it to come to you. \n With Pluto in your sign, you\u2019re learning about your personal power, sometimes through complicated life lessons and experiences. This year, Pluto will have the greatest impact on Aquarians born approximately January 21-23, who will be taking a deep look within as they uncover facets of their personality that they haven\u2019t yet accepted or even acknowledged, and this can be uncomfortable at times but ultimately rewarding. \n Uranus has been a long-term guest in your home and family sector, and it is transitioning into your creativity sector this year. The move will be complete next year, but in 2025, you\u2019re getting a taste of this energy. You can attract exciting and unusual people into your creative, recreational, or romantic world, although permanency is in question. Your tastes can vacillate. Exploring new hobbies or different forms of leisure and entertainment can be in focus. Creatively speaking, you will be blossoming this year and beyond \u2013 you will discover new and unique forms of creative expression. \n More:  Aquarius Yearly Preview Horoscope for 2025  or  Aquarius  for 2025 \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Aquarius \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Aquarius \n Love and pleasure are headlines for you in 2025, dear Aquarius.

It can also bring more opportunities to date and connect with others romantically. \n These are not necessarily the types of relationships that lead quickly to commitment, but they\u2019re enjoyable and confidence-boosting.

Even so, it's a powerful time to attack your \"to-do\" list. The month is strong for family, romance, creativity, and work. The month is electric for your relationships on some levels. Still, with Venus in your sector of heart and home from the 6th onward, you're also a bit self-protective with your feelings even though you are generally willing to enjoy yourself. \n Much of the month, passions are strong, and a partner can be more active, assertive, or temperamental than usual. You're ready to attack problems from the root rather than falling back on quick bandaid fixes. You have real admirers this month. Recreation, leisure activities, hobbies, and entertainment are in strong focus. You can be motivated to share ideas, affection, or entertainment with others. Fun interests and opportunities to enjoy yourself can emerge, and you appreciate the extra warmth and positivity in your interactions. Enjoying yourself and celebrating may be in order now. \n With your sector of joy activated, a lighter, less burdened feeling is with you. You are discovering your inner muse and embarking on a fresh start in your creative pursuits. Although your love life is likely to be changeable, good things are happening, and others are finding you especially easy to be around. Romance is full-on in June for some, with lively conversations and much stimulation. Problems in relationships are readily aired. Fortunately, you have all the skills at your disposal to iron out differences. \n An introspective turn emerges slowly but surely as the month advances, starting with Venus heading into your home and family sector on the 6th. This is the first and perhaps the strongest hint that you need some personal time. While you may want to watch for playing it a little too safe for your own good now, it\u2019s a powerful period for finding your emotional center and getting in touch with your needs for safety, nurture, and security. There can be fresh starts with a family member, a new or improved relationship with someone close to you, or happier, more supportive living conditions. \n Mars in your partnership and then intimacy sectors this month can definitely heat up and animate your closest relationships. While some may face difficulties with an overbearing partner, this is a good time to make changes and alleviate some of the building tension. This period favors confronting problems head-on with direct and assertive Mars involved. \n The Full Moon on the 11th can open your eyes (or perhaps more aptly, your heart) to a need for friendship, a feeling of belonging to something bigger than yourself, a satisfying social life, or a desire to contribute. You may have been feeling stuck with your current pursuits or overwhelmed with things to do, and this frustration can lead to an epiphany about your true feelings on a matter. Expect a rush of emotions and perhaps surprising epiphanies as you awaken to needs you may have been suppressing. It's a time to confront feelings. \n From the 17th forward, you\u2019re in a particularly good position to observe and strategize your next moves. After an extended stay in your partnership sector, Mars moves into your intimacy sector, pulling you into your own head or more deeply into a relationship or special project. While exciting on many levels, this is not the most comfortable place for Mars, and it can sometimes feel difficult to assert yourself directly or straightforwardly during this cycle. It is useful, however, for digging things up and stirring up passions and desires you may have ignored or buried. \n With Saturn now transiting your communications sector, you're challenged to channel your energies more constructively. This transit is a longer-term event, running until September 1st this year and then continuing from February 2026 to April 2028. In the period ahead, you might take up structured learning or bring more discipline to your work or studies. You tend to communicate with more authority, and with more focus and structure, you can become quite skilled at a particular subject. Some distancing yourself from others might occur with new interests and responsibilities, however. \n It\u2019s a supportive transit overall\u2013one in which you\u2019re more able to meet your obligations. You\u2019re keeping your cool! Life feels more stable. It\u2019s a fine time for learning better concentration and the ability to listen and absorb lessons/information. You\u2019re developing mental discipline and organization. \n This month, Jupiter moves into a new area of your solar chart, where it will transit for over a year (until June 2026). It's a significant development that will expand the nature and scope of your daily activities and routines. You\u2019ll discover more meaning and joy in your work or daily affairs. Opportunities for improved working conditions and advancement are likely. Your positive attitude toward your job or duties could play a key role in attracting these opportunities and potential windfalls. You might also enjoy a stronger interest in nutrition, cleaner living, and fitness. You\u2019ll find new ways to manage and improve your daily life, but there can be some initial dissatisfaction before you feel the drive to make improvements and refinements. \n However, there can be a clash between your increased desire to pursue work and health activities and your responsibilities to others or special projects and personal interests. It can be challenging to juggle all that you have going on at this time! As best as you can, aim to get a handle on your priorities to navigate these areas. \n Work and health improvements are in the works as June advances, especially after the New Moon on the 25th, setting the tone for the few weeks ahead. You are well-positioned to make lifestyle changes, improve your habits, and find more meaning and happiness in your work. \n Even before this New Moon, however, the practical side of life takes on increasing importance, with Mercury in your work and health sector from the 8th to the 26th and the Sun there from the 20th onward. This a brilliant time for making lists and plans, getting organized, and taking care of business. The focus should be on improving your daily life and habits, and you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities and motivation to do so. Tame the inclination to take on too much, and you\u2019ll be in great shape to get your life into better working order. \n These influences encourage good (and smart) work habits as well as special attention to the small things that make your world go \u2019round! This can be a time of addressing minor issues and ensuring your routines work for you, not against you. It\u2019s an excellent time for honing skills and learning useful things. You\u2019ll find yourself with more energy to invest in work, organizing your personal environment, and health routines. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Detail",

It's a brilliant period for coming up with long-range plans. Seeing things positively in your personal life can be refreshing, and being more present with loved ones or attentive to your domestic world is especially rewarding. \n A strong domestic theme continues this month. Family matters are in the spotlight, and your daily life or work is super busy in the first half of June. You may be in a position to prove yourself on the job, or your inner motivation to do your best or achieve your goals is strong. You\u2019ll want to improve living conditions and enjoy life at home, in familiar settings, or with family. However, there are also powerful relationship and communication themes that deserve special attention, and they build as the month advances. \n In fact, intellectual companionship is easy to find this month from the 6th forward. This is perhaps the first sign from the cosmos that you\u2019re pulling out of yourself this month: Venus moves into your sector of communications, connections, transportation, ideas, and mental outlook. It\u2019s a great time for engaging in interesting conversations, exploring diverse subjects, and pursuing fun studies. You\u2019re inclined to reach out a little more, and as you do, you gain new inspiration. Softening your communications works beautifully in your favor during this transit. Projects are enjoyable, and the connections you make feel warm and rewarding. \n So, while June begins with a focus on your personal needs and domestic world, it becomes increasingly more interactive, sociable, and creative as it progresses. Mercury transits your solar fifth house from the 8th to the 26th, sparking up your creative side, particularly on a mental level. It\u2019s a time for enjoying learning, sharing, and connecting more than usual, especially in combination with the Venus transit\u2013these two transits complement one another well. You can produce some wonderful writing now, or your projects, hobbies, and pastimes are more enjoyable. The power of your words is now evident, bringing new opportunities into your life, and word of mouth works well for you, too. \n The Full Moon on the 11th can illuminate a career or reputation matter that needs your attention or cuts into your personal time. You're called upon to bring more creativity, feeling, or heart into your career or life plan. This Full Moon can signal an epiphany or turning point regarding a career, family, or home matter. It can push you into the spotlight or out of your comfort zone for a couple of days, requiring you to attend to your responsibilities to the outside world. It\u2019s also a fine time to connect with your feelings on a work project or long-term goal. \n As the month progresses, relationships become more lively. Assertive, active, and sometimes impatient Mars enters your partnership sector on the 17th, and you (or a partner) are/is no longer willing to sweep problems under the carpet. It's a time for taking action in a relationship or partnering up for activities. Passions rise, and assertiveness increases in your relationships. Issues that have been buried or working under the surface now emerge for handling. While these matters should be addressed, focusing some of this excess energy on shared activities can be helpful for taking the pressure off from time to time. \n This Mars transit is revealing and stimulating but does require some mindfulness and self-awareness since there can be a strong inclination to project traits onto others rather than take ownership of them during this period. \n Saturn left your sign in late May, entering your solar second house, where it will transit for quite some time. You\u2019ll feel a little freer, less weighed down, and more spontaneous during this cycle. Ideally, you are a more mature and balanced person after Saturn\u2019s transit of your sign, and now is the time to focus on making your life more secure. You\u2019ve built strength and balance in your life in recent years, and confidence now comes from a firmer grip on reality and what\u2019s truly possible. Note that Saturn will return to Pisces from September 1-February 13, after which it continues its transit of your resources sector until April 2028. \n Getting serious about finances or facing reality regarding money may be part of the picture. This transit is about taking more control over your money, resources, or talents, which helps you feel empowered. Even so, living a little leaner can be part of the picture. \n This month, Jupiter moves into your sector of joy, where it will visit until June 2026! This transit blesses your leisurely activities, dating life, and creative worlds for a little over a year. You enjoy increased popularity, and you can be excited to break free from certain inhibitions about expressing yourself. You have been doing a lot of \"work\" on yourself recently, and now is the time to share the \"new you\" (which is still, in fact, in the process of evolution). New hobbies are very possible. This could be anything from painting to gardening to learning a musical instrument. Channels for fun, love, and self-expression are opening! New opportunities to truly enjoy yourself through recreation, pastimes, and other amusements will likely come your way. Romantic opportunities also expand. \n Still, you might juggle worries about money or comfort and your increased desire for entertainment and pleasure at times in June. You may need to get creative about balancing your financial responsibilities and stronger need for security while also answering a call to enjoy and express yourself. \n Beautiful energy is with you on social and learning levels in the last ten days of the month. This is a time for making exciting new connections and enlivening current relationships. From the 20th forward, you\u2019re branching out and coming out of your shell more often with the Sun visiting your sector of joy, recreation, hobbies, and self-expression. \n The New Moon on the 25th can rekindle or cement your commitment to enjoying yourself and exploring romance, leisure, or creative avenues. It marks a strong period for personal enjoyment and discovery. You might make connections that advance your personal interests, and especially the more heartfelt pursuits. New hobbies or avenues for entertainment and creative expression could be just around the corner. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year: Pisces 2025 \n The year ahead is stronger for your relationships, in general, dear Pisces, and especially love and fun friendships. You\u2019re also a lot more grounded and confident as Saturn begins its transition out of your sign. Ideally, you use the transit of Jupiter to your solar fourth house until June to the utmost \u2013 filling your inner well and strengthening ties with loved ones. This way, by June 9th, you can bring more natural confidence to a new cycle that involves exploring your playful, dramatic, and creative side. \n The year 2025 is strong for home improvements, updates, upgrades, and boosts. Making your life more secure and safe can be a huge motivator. Certainly, your definition of comfort, abundance, security, and pleasure is evolving this year and the next. Working from or on the home can be in the spotlight. \n Love is easier this year. Romantic, playful, and casual relationships in the second half of the year are in the spotlight. New avenues for recreation, amusement, creative expression, and hobbies can open up. Pursuing your joy comes more naturally. \n Saturn is beginning its transition into your money and values sector this year, which can promote a feeling that you\u2019re pinched in the money department, but this can serve to motivate you to work harder and save more. With Uranus moving into your home and family sector, there can be some shuffling around, redecorating, a move, or experiences that have you doing your domestic world differently. \n Neptune, your ruler, has been visiting your sign for many years, but is now beginning its slow exit. You\u2019re closing chapters on a spiritual quest for meaning and a period when you tended to go with the flow. As Saturn moves on from Pisces as well in 2025 and 2026, your personality is lighter, freer, and less pressured. \n The year brings increased feelings of security and joy in your home life, a stronger sense of confidence emanating from within, and wonderful channels for enjoying and expressing yourself. \n More:  2025 Pisces   or  2025 Pisces  \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n This Year in Love: Pisces \n \u00a0 \n 2025 Love Horoscope for Pisces \n The year ahead is one of many shifts, dear Pisces, including your modern ruler, Neptune, beginning the process of heading out of Pisces. Neptune doesn\u2019t change signs very often! As such, you can experience a shift as you adapt to this transition. You\u2019re feeling more determined and can be more outgoing. Another sign that you\u2019re coming out of your shell: Jupiter, the planet of expansion, moves into your romance sector on June 9th. It\u2019s a love-friendly cycle that also finds you more expressive and playful. \n Until then, Jupiter spends time in your family, home, and soul sector, which is a strong influence for living conditions and happiness on the domestic front. Your joy and happiness levels at home or with family get a real boost. \n While it\u2019s not explicitly strong for romantic relationships, if you use this gentle, quiet transit well and look very carefully for opportunities, you can better prepare yourself for the more overt opportunities of the upcoming Jupiter transit that begins in June 2025. This is about learning to be more comfortable in your own skin. Slowly, you are building up your confidence\u2026 cont\u2019d \n More:  2025 Pisces Love Horoscope \n Special note concerning Covid-19 \n Special note: \n Astrological transits continue in their cyclical ways no matter the current situation. They should always be adapted to what\u2019s going on in your life in sensible ways. This applies at all times, but is particularly relevant now during this health crisis. During the quarantines, if the planetary transits are suggesting it\u2019s a great time to socialize, for example, it makes sense to adapt this to online socializing. Let\u2019s be safe and protect one another through social distancing, when possible. Much love, Annie (March 18, 2020) \n My heart goes out to all those experiencing difficulty.

It's a brilliant period for coming up with long-range plans. Seeing things positively in your personal life can be refreshing, and being more present with loved ones or attentive to your domestic world is especially rewarding. \n A strong domestic theme continues this month. Family matters are in the spotlight, and your daily life or work is super busy in the first half of June. You may be in a position to prove yourself on the job, or your inner motivation to do your best or achieve your goals is strong. You\u2019ll want to improve living conditions and enjoy life at home, in familiar settings, or with family. However, there are also powerful relationship and communication themes that deserve special attention, and they build as the month advances. \n In fact, intellectual companionship is easy to find this month from the 6th forward. This is perhaps the first sign from the cosmos that you\u2019re pulling out of yourself this month: Venus moves into your sector of communications, connections, transportation, ideas, and mental outlook. It\u2019s a great time for engaging in interesting conversations, exploring diverse subjects, and pursuing fun studies. You\u2019re inclined to reach out a little more, and as you do, you gain new inspiration. Softening your communications works beautifully in your favor during this transit. Projects are enjoyable, and the connections you make feel warm and rewarding. \n So, while June begins with a focus on your personal needs and domestic world, it becomes increasingly more interactive, sociable, and creative as it progresses. Mercury transits your solar fifth house from the 8th to the 26th, sparking up your creative side, particularly on a mental level. It\u2019s a time for enjoying learning, sharing, and connecting more than usual, especially in combination with the Venus transit\u2013these two transits complement one another well. You can produce some wonderful writing now, or your projects, hobbies, and pastimes are more enjoyable. The power of your words is now evident, bringing new opportunities into your life, and word of mouth works well for you, too. \n The Full Moon on the 11th can illuminate a career or reputation matter that needs your attention or cuts into your personal time. You're called upon to bring more creativity, feeling, or heart into your career or life plan. This Full Moon can signal an epiphany or turning point regarding a career, family, or home matter. It can push you into the spotlight or out of your comfort zone for a couple of days, requiring you to attend to your responsibilities to the outside world. It\u2019s also a fine time to connect with your feelings on a work project or long-term goal. \n As the month progresses, relationships become more lively. Assertive, active, and sometimes impatient Mars enters your partnership sector on the 17th, and you (or a partner) are/is no longer willing to sweep problems under the carpet. It's a time for taking action in a relationship or partnering up for activities. Passions rise, and assertiveness increases in your relationships. Issues that have been buried or working under the surface now emerge for handling. While these matters should be addressed, focusing some of this excess energy on shared activities can be helpful for taking the pressure off from time to time. \n This Mars transit is revealing and stimulating but does require some mindfulness and self-awareness since there can be a strong inclination to project traits onto others rather than take ownership of them during this period. \n Saturn left your sign in late May, entering your solar second house, where it will transit for quite some time. You\u2019ll feel a little freer, less weighed down, and more spontaneous during this cycle. Ideally, you are a more mature and balanced person after Saturn\u2019s transit of your sign, and now is the time to focus on making your life more secure. You\u2019ve built strength and balance in your life in recent years, and confidence now comes from a firmer grip on reality and what\u2019s truly possible. Note that Saturn will return to Pisces from September 1-February 13, after which it continues its transit of your resources sector until April 2028. \n Getting serious about finances or facing reality regarding money may be part of the picture. This transit is about taking more control over your money, resources, or talents, which helps you feel empowered. Even so, living a little leaner can be part of the picture. \n This month, Jupiter moves into your sector of joy, where it will visit until June 2026! This transit blesses your leisurely activities, dating life, and creative worlds for a little over a year. You enjoy increased popularity, and you can be excited to break free from certain inhibitions about expressing yourself. You have been doing a lot of \"work\" on yourself recently, and now is the time to share the \"new you\" (which is still, in fact, in the process of evolution). New hobbies are very possible. This could be anything from painting to gardening to learning a musical instrument. Channels for fun, love, and self-expression are opening! New opportunities to truly enjoy yourself through recreation, pastimes, and other amusements will likely come your way. Romantic opportunities also expand. \n Still, you might juggle worries about money or comfort and your increased desire for entertainment and pleasure at times in June. You may need to get creative about balancing your financial responsibilities and stronger need for security while also answering a call to enjoy and express yourself. \n Beautiful energy is with you on social and learning levels in the last ten days of the month. This is a time for making exciting new connections and enlivening current relationships. From the 20th forward, you\u2019re branching out and coming out of your shell more often with the Sun visiting your sector of joy, recreation, hobbies, and self-expression. \n The New Moon on the 25th can rekindle or cement your commitment to enjoying yourself and exploring romance, leisure, or creative avenues. It marks a strong period for personal enjoyment and discovery. You might make connections that advance your personal interests, and especially the more heartfelt pursuits. New hobbies or avenues for entertainment and creative expression could be just around the corner. \n More:  Monthly Horoscopes \u2013 Details",
